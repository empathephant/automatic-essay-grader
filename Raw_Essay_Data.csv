Many of them rather to work abroad than stay in Taiwan to work as much but get paid less. Some employers would believe that people in my age are not resiponsible enough to give us better salary; however, it's not true just because we are younger and grew up with better financial environment. Reasons for us to get paid higher are that we are creative on project and we are willing to work hard if the company can treat us equally.       First,  our generation is called the Millianer. People are connected with the world in their early age since they have computer and internet. The various information online facilitates them to update themselves faster. People accumulate new ideas from internet to make a better one. As a result, employers should not define us as 'a group of strawbettey,' which means that we cannot afford any stress from outside world. We have different trait, but the employers can make a good use of it.        Second, If our government can leigulrate labor right more appropriately, it will motivate us to work even harder. People who work hard should get paid double when they work overtime. Comparing to people from last generation  that they are very diligent, but they get paid more. In contrast, people in my age work hard why we can be paid less.  Moreover, we are more likely to be willing to work for the company for a long turn.        To sum up, people are not only working for salary, but also we are pursuing a better life. We are not lazy. In contrast , we are very creative and willing challenge different ideas to make the world a better one.  Our government should take serious consideration to save this genernation from going abroad to seek better salary, but create a better friendly environment for us to stay.  If the improvement can happen somedays, the world will be a better one.",5.04W16 Placement,66948,"My descripcion is the mach intereses from estudentstheer tha people,","Im one improvement the city My opinin is the mach peolple ther is potential and talents.My specific reasons is the have mach people celebrat",0.36W16 Placement,32253,"My family in the Taiwan ,My vervy like my family",,0.36W16 Placement,01835,"my father is hte best becaus my help ,ther is a pesonality wath there the he and is your persevens .tha people they have your  , how can you la peopletake tobe best","my city would change and survavio becaus in that  from is warning  and me to humillidy for the  people how the country wath evirythink so if country wath is must warning ,now is the best from fine ,and that' good I'm thank so. me too .

Obviously if them recieved the solution of this problem the drivers will have a good travel to their destination, and for the people I would be more comfortable to walk in a sidewalk. Other thing to fix is  is the public transportation, because many people use buses in my city, and I think that the buses are not enought for all the people that need them, In many other parts we can see the same, or other reality, for example, I like this of Provo because, It have enough buses for people, but It is also bad in other things like don't give any of your change, and also they have a weird schedule. Other thing that I will change in my city is make more recreative zones, for example In my city we only have a mall, we don't have any court to play football (soccer), only I can play in the chapel, It was one of the parts in my city where you can find a court. I think that this is an important cause because people stay in their houses, this especially will help to older people. I think that with this thing that people will have a more happiest life throwing away the worries. If my city would have this things.

There is no such a good public schools in Sao Paulo.

When you get better opportunities, means that you propably will be able to provide your family as well as give them an opportunity to be happier.Furthermore education leads a person to a higher way to live allowing that person to better problem solve, better discuss his ideas and lead his family in a better way.My view about a better education for the people I used to live with is to get a immediate effect but a long term effect. if starting today we could build a better education in Sao Paulo, probably in 20 years from now the people would starts to realize  the benefits of the improvement of the education.

best every day to show my family that his son can be ehat they always wants him be ... im so happy for his opportunitie to be in the elc ... will be grat i know that....","i think that one of the reasons for what i like the US is because you can work and study and that is something imposible in Chile .. you have 2 options  you work or study .. i really woud like that the university change his classes and give time to  the students to work  'cause  thay can not pay anything until they  have finish their studies ... and when they are studing his parents  have to pay everything ... food.. clothing....if they have a car o whatever they have are their parents how have to pay for that .... i like when i was in brazil 'cause the people there can choose the time that they will study ... and they have 3 options in the morning , in the day (1pm until7pm)  or in the night 8pm to 12 .... i think that things like that in chile will help a lot of people  ( friends and family) to have a better life with their families .... and their parents ( students parents) will be so happy  'cause they don't have to pay the collage to their  childrens ...also i thing that  ... the students who are working their ...  try to do more... then the peolple that his parents are paying  everything to them 'cause they will know how hard is got money so they will apreciate more  and probably they will think batter before spend money in  things that does't have a real importance .another benefit that will bring the change in the schoolar time ( collage , university .etc) is that this young adults will have the oportunitie to get merried ' ... and keep that commandament of God ... for example my cousin he comeback from his mission like 4 years ego and he is single jet .. en when the people ask him why is him single jet ... he answer ... how ill support a family im studing i don't have money im living with my mom ... i woud like but is not possible jet ...  i have thinking  a lot about him , he is a great guy anda he has a big testimony  of the gospel ... he is an exemple to me in rightouness  ... so i think in the people like him in mine country and city  that will be so happy to have the oportunity to work and study at the same time .. is not something easy to do but is something that will help them to be more autosuficient and independant  and the most important thing that i think is that they will be happy ..",3.03S17 Placement,47072,"i am living with my brother nears to BYU.

Provo is a city thats you need to transporting in every time, you need to go to the lunch in your house or go to the gym or visit a friend and the distance is far away one onother.so the people live in Provo would benefit from this little improvement in the city so there are many peoples of different countries also benefit from this.the potential immediate and long-term consequences of this improvement its many student can move the one place another with more facilty and cheap, beacouse they dont need to buy a car.",3.03S17 Placement,08316,"I am living with my friends.

Do they have a specicifc place or spot to do it and congregate? What am I saying with that? Youth like to socialize and spend time doing fun activities but sometimes they do not know what to do or where to go. That is why I think that creating a huge building just for the youth entertainment is a great way to maintain them together in a good and healthy enviroment where people can hang out there. I am going to explain a little bit more about this building that I already mentioned. This building  has to be created just for the youth , having different areas. For example, a bowling area, a chillin area with coutches and a huge TV to whatch movies or to make a cinema night with pop corns or just talk, a gym area or even a kitcken where youth can cook together. They key of it is that people can meet their friends there and know more people in such a good enviroment as they can find in this building.  Parents also can go there and see what their 'children' are doing so that they can be sure they are safe, altough this building us just exclusive for the youth. I think this type of idea will increase a healthy, positive and safety enviroment  for them because they can use any time they want and also can make reservations for a huge group of people. This will decreased bad and dangerous situations such a going or descovering new places with  a unsafe enviroment like a clubs or other areas that aren't created for young people. Another consequence is that young people will know and will feel that the goverment of the city is considering them in consideration. When they make the announment of having a new building just for them and showing the plan and pictures of it, the youth and without doubt the parents, will be excited and happy for having this new oportunity in their city.  So, this is something that also help the goverment or politic group or organization of teh city to have more votes or just with the knowledge that they are making happy the citizens. Taking care of the youth is the same that taking care of the future. All this consequences and more, are both potencial immediate consequences and long term consequences of this improvement.",3.04W17 LATs,32472,"When I was arrived first time I met my roommates.

In this essay I'm going to write why live city is better than country and reasons. First. in the city have a good transportaion system. They have a subway and buses even if they have a tram on the way. For example, the Provo have a only few buses and they don't has any subway or trams. Howeber in the Saltlake city has a bus and tram. They has more transportation system than Prove. Second, The city have a lot of things. They have a lot of stores and department stores. Also, they have a big hospitar in the city. They has a lot of place to good to play. In the other hand country has only few things.In the country is quiet and they has few stores and small hospitar. Many of young generation feel boring because they don't have any good place to play.Finally, almost young people like more energitic than quiet place. They wants exciting and something fun every day. The country is also good to live but it feel boring and repeat every same day. It means really safe place than city but young people choose more exciting place.In conclusion, Many young people especially my generation likes to live city.

These can help people go to they want to go place, and don't need a lot of money  and long time. Second, a whole city should be have some parks.

Some people can be able to pay for their education but some do not have this opportunity. The problem is that there are no places of part-time work for students.

For example, I left univesity because I could not study and work full time in the same time, I needed to chose only one. My parents were not able to help me with finances. If I was be able to find a job for 3-4 hours a day then it would be possible for me to stay and finish my school.  It will be a great value for young people who wants to get a good education.

Soccer is the most popular sport in France, there is lot of interest for this sport and lots of people play this game or watch it at TV. Because of this stadium people can meet together and spend some times to play and have a great moment. It's important having this kind of place where people can meet them. Thanks to that people can know them each other. For the life of my little town this stadium can create a link between all the people of the town. We can create a team for each age of population and create a tournament witch will take place every years. It will be a party for all people of the town and all the others in the countryside around. This stadium can be an attractive thing for new people who are looking for somewhere to live in. It is very difficult for little town like mine to attract new people but it is very important to keep a school in the town, to keep bakery, and proximity services. I think that a soccer stadium is the immediate best solution for increase the way of life of my age people and the best for long-term consequences to help my town growing up again and make it attractive.",3.06S17 Placement,11080,"I would like to talk about my mission trainnner, he was an amazing elder we worked a lot in our area, he was learning to talk Spanish and I remember that he was my first English teacher that I had, he was very kind and a lovely guy, he is taller than me I think he is almost 2 meters, and he is very funny all the time he is making or saying something funny, he wasn't the best roomate because he never cleaned the room, he all the time was studying or in the kitchen, he was my first example in the mission field, I remember that I had a great admiration for him because he was very humble and he had a great heart, he never thinks in himself, he always was thinking about how he can help other people , before going to the mission he was working in a company called IBM as an programator,  he told me that that job was the best job in earth because he really likes to do that and because he had many hours off to do other things,  when I received the news that my trainner was leaving  the house I was very sad.","Well I am going to talk about my city Bogota, this city is a good palce to live,  but it has many challenges especially for young people, the best improvement that could make my city is to offer more opportunities to study, in that place  you spend the entire day working hard, and if you don't have money, or if you don't have a sponsor you will not  be able to study,  so I think in that city we have great people, most of them are smart people, but now they are getting bad jobs because their education, if the universities  would take more care about this population, they will be able to open an online program or even thought an online carrer,  that is the easy way to affer the opportunity to study to this people that have to work because they are supporting their families,  some people that are studying online with universities from other countries say that it is more harder to study online, but the young population don't really care about that, because, as I said before they are  good people they are smart people but because of the condition they cannot study,  they have desires, they have the dream, and the most important they have the passion,  so if the goverment and the universities work hand in hand in a few years we will see how increase the professional population, we will see, how worldwide companies see our city as an great estrategic point to stablish their companies, this is the best way to offer a better place to our young population, but what happen is that in that city the government work against the people, they don't really care about the poor population, and the taxes in that city is crazy,  so I ask to myself how can we build a great country without creating opportunities to growth and development ? I think our city is a blessed city, we have everything we have a great potential to create powerful industries and solid businesses, as I always say, we are a rich country living in poourness,  all of this conflicts is about a bad administration of our GPO, and a bad administration of all the resources that we have, the best way to improve our nation and create a better place to live is investing in the poor population,  if we do that we will stablish a solid economy and a strong country, but we need to work together, we need the help of the government, and the universities, because for today just the rich people have access to an education, and the education is the key of the development, our goal should be put the education at reach of all the people,  we need to create  financials systems to be completelly surre that all the people that want to study  will be able to attend to the university,  if you get a debt for studies, that is a wise debt,  otherwise that is not a good idea to get a debt, but if you are poor and you go the the bank anyone will give you the oportunity to have the required amount to asists to the university,  this is a great problem that we have today and is a problem that have an easy solution, this is more about think about the people.",3.06W17 LATs,29188,"I am from Peru and I live in the capital called Lima.

And I had different kind of pets , and I consider them part of my family. My last pet called Pinina was the most important for me because it still lives with us as ten years, so I really liked to spend time with it. My house is not big  because my parents work in the Army , they  are working almost whole day so for that they tried to find an apartment.

She has a strong personality and she administrate the economy . I am here studying for her help and that is incredible.","During all the semester was really difficult for me to understand the purpose to think about the differences and comparison between different countries. I remember my listening class and specially an assigment that permit me to think about how we can be better people. The example that my teacher gave me was about a man  who tried to get to  Antartic and  the difficulties that he and his people experienced. But watching this documental, it is important to catch the main point of the story. And it is not the traveling , the main point is the man  who was the best example. When I saw this video , I was watching the news. A really big disaster was happening in  my country and all the people there did not know how to do for being saved. The situation became more harder and we were waiting for our president words to tell us what the people needed to act . In that moment I compare this man with my president . And I understood that my president had to change his mind and tried to be a good leader to transmit safety for his country and his people. I realized that my president follows different principal points from this man , my city specially in that bad situation will be a better place to live . There are three important points that my president need to cahenge from this man. The first one is to think and take care for his people before him. That is going to permit to understand different people situations and their problems.  Sometimes we do not take time to think about people who are close of us. People are going to trust more in my president if they percibe that he is trying to understand their problems. The second point is after they understand their problems , they are going to distribute the same jobs or duties . This man did in that way  and that worked . In my country , it is not hard to realize the difference between rich and poor people. It is not bad to have the difference  but sometimes people do not use this difference to do good things. We can see bad things  and procedure for the goverment for this problem . They think that can solve all their problems just paying . But they can do it , it is the sad face of my country. And that began from my president . He does not try to stop this unfair situation. He needs to change that part because if the people realize that he wants the same things for all of them and he uses the justice to get benefits in the same level, they are going to do their best to believe in him. The last point is to work together. This man never left the duties for his people and he worked with them. Thar was an important point to be a good example.

For example the contamination is one of the biggest problems in my country and the crime, the people needs do not traughht the trash because that affect the environment, the security  needs to change, I think than is the best have more security in the streets and all the stores in the city.The people should to thing different because for the city will have the best  future for the next generation.

First need to change the education in Mexico, the old people need to put more effort and more dedication in the children because many childrens follow the examples of the adults.Now, Mexico is not the best place for live but if the people change your form of think, if the people put more dedication in the education of the children and adults, the place will shange a lot. I really love my county but ti is true than the education is not the best in the place. The economic in my country is a little bad for the same of the work, many people live with for the money of the tourist because Mexico is very visit because have many colorfull, beautiful and big places. The handicrafts are one of the most important people in Mexico because they have many things thann represent our country",3.07F15 LATs,22107,"My mother is a amazing woman.

We need more teachers can to work with the youth and to want help them, because a lot of the youth do not receive love from their families, and this is so bad for them, because they look the things they do not received in their home in the street, and the sad thing is bad people help them. I think the sport is a good idea to better the city, because sports teachs responsability, hard work, and help to meet new people, and have a better health and be more happy, when the people have problems can relax doing sports, and think better with calm and to find a solution for their problems, and share with others about their life, their hobbies and their goals.I know the best thing for youth is to do good activities, and there are a lot of sports the youth can to choose and enjoy. The sports can help the youth to know more about them, and they can have new experiences in competition, and why not be proffesionals in the future.When I was more young the sports help me a lot to lost my fair, to have more confidence in me, and to have goals, and to be more focus in my study.

First the teens don't are conscious of dangerous that drink a lot of alcohol at night , second when they are intoxicated don't control them acts. i think that this reason are very important for the society and need reconsideration.The young don't think that city like bogota has a lot of thief and they don't can defend if to be intoxicated. also, into the bar the people asks more money and take advantage of this condition. When the people is more oldest know the dangerous and nothing bentured both.The most worrying is when the teen to be intoxicated don't control the acts and words. for example is normally the young people in bogota, fighter and kill to other people when was drinking, and It is really bad for all problems that has a people after the fight. I think that is no just with the families.In conclusion Bogota need change the rules for a youngs for have a better city and improve the medios for law enforcement. as soon as the law change the streets in bogota will more security for the youngs and they will more control that them acts.I would like see the new law in Bogota.",3.08W16 Placement,90088,"When I was in Barranquilla I lived with my parents, Julia and Ramon, and one of my sisters, Jenny.

Almost 60% of citizens are young people. But the young people are not excited about their city. The reason is the air pollution. In the end of 1990, The prevalence of the air pollution did not exist. Because of the population of city was not reached today's record. Government of that time used to compell people to live in particular area. After 1990, Mongolian society and authority shifted to democracy. The weak government could not handle as much things and democracy was the thoroughly new idea to everyone. Only imagination that people have was the idea of 'doing whatever you want'. Also, economic of country was close to bankrupcy. To live and find better life, people were fleeing to capital city which was designed to specific number of people. There was deficiency of apartments. Thus, those people who came from rural areas could not find houses and the government had lack of abililty to solve it due to economic crises. So, people build thier own houses that heated by fire. From then on, it has become the root of air pollution. Now, 70% of apartments are heated by fire and our city is the one of the most polluted city in the world. People in my age are not pleased with that because it causes dozens of health problems. They are concerning about their children. In my opinion, the only solution could be our action, however, the government must handle it. If we use gas instead of coal air pollution will be dissapear soon. The morality is more important than any others. If people respect each other's right, not only air pollution could be solved, but every problem on earth would be gone.

Only a little percent of people with resources can choose them own majors because they are studing in priverty universities.      For that my city can be a better place to live for the people of my age, the gobernants need to create a new opportunities for education, new programs of study and better places to be focus in our majors and not in others things that is not with our majors. In Guayaquil, my city is very usual find a lot young people that is not studing because do not have the resources for study that majors that they want and they are dessapointed with the gobern for not let the opportunitie that they choose them major in consequence we can see a lot people without morals and without employes, a lot families with house or diarily food in them home.      I think that all persons in my country need to have the same opportunities for them education and should have equality.

Making them learn the english language will enable them to progress and prosper in life.The english language is known to be  the universal language and because of this, countries are being connected. First, everyone needs progress everyday. By letting them learn the universal language, it will help them progress in life. In addition, as they grow, they will have extra ordinary experience  in  life that will enable them to encounter things about the language. For example, talking to tourists. Phillippines is known to have many tourists spots that foreigners visits. If the people my age know how to speak the english language, they can share their knowledge about a certain tourist spot. They can help in the progress of the country by merely leading the way for tourists. Another example is that, they will attend university in the future that offers english subjects. It will give them enough experience in dealing with it. Second, learning the language will help them prosper in life. They should learn how to manipulate the language in order to find a great job in the future. As they deal more with life situations, they will be able to create a change that my city needs. The prosperity that will ensure their family's or other people's lives will depend on the decision they make today. I will encourage not only people my age, but also everyone who wants to learn the language. When people learn at a young age, they are more likely to have progress and prosper in life, but it doesn't mean that adults can't.

Some of those beaches are perfect for surfing and with more attencion for surf events We can make more financial movimmentation.People with my age will be enjoy the benefits of this improvement because: with more tourists around we can have more urban quality, and the consequence is more security.

Living in a safe city is priceless, seriously it is. So now I will write about this: Security.I think if we would have more security in my city it would be a better place to live for people like me, because when we feel safe we can make more things feelling better or free, for example:To study. We could go to the university, colleges and schools more confidents, even if is late. In my city so many times the young people don't want to go to study because is dangerous and that's is a difficult for our lifes.To help others. If we feel safe we can help other people, like homeless or people that need food or work . To make decisions. So many times we feel scared about the dangerous future, so we are afraid to make decisions today. I wrote about the securiy because I think is a thing in the world  super necessary today. I live in Chile, in Santiago city. I love that place but recently I dind't feel safe. I can see more countries, like Venenzuela, they really need security to live.Sometimes we think the most importan things for the young people is fun, and yes, maybe is a important thing, but without security, how we can be fun?

So, they'd really benefit a lot participating in this center and their familes would do, too. This idea is so important to me because, nowadays we see that most of young people is in drugs, alcohol, vandalism, parties and many more bad things they do with their bodies making problems in society or affecting themselves or their families and others. But, you maybe ask yourselves, how can I call their attention? I mean, how they are going to have the desire to participate in the project. Well, it's easy, I'd invite each young personally to participate of the program, and little by little I'll have more participants to do that assignment of recruiting. I'll present my project to the government and I'm sure they'd accept it. So, if they participate in this project, they'd have their minds and time bussy, they'd learn new things for their lives for fun and they would be able to share their new talents with other young people and the center would increase a lot. Also, if they wish they could specialize as professional singers, dancers or whatever is related to the Music and they'd earn a lot of money and they'd be able to help others as they were helped by the center.

Tourists travel to leon because was a first city funded or discovered in 1524 for Spanish people. Also, we have ruins that represent the ancient population of many years ago. The construction of a place close to the lake can be a good way for bring tourists more fast because this place can be a port. This place can comunicate the capital with the north west of the country. In addition, young people would work in this place, and they would prepare better in the school and learn other language. Tourists will bring money to my city and improve the economy. Young people need to progress and the best way is hard work. Young people need a motive and inspiration, and I think that this place help so much becuase will create new forms for to have money.

There are more than 10 million people live in my city. In my opinion, I think wage is one improvement that would make my city become a better place to live for people who have same age like me.     Why I talk about wage? Maybe cause by our population. I told you that how many people in my city. So we couldn't earn a lot of money when we graduate from college. In general, we can earn from 500 to 700 dollars for each month. Maybe you will say these moneys will be enough to live. I will say no. If you are native who have a house in SuZhou. You don't need to worry about the rent. We just need to worry about something that we need to use or eat. But if you are not native who have a house in SuZhou. You need to worry about your rent, food, clothes,etc. These moneys won't be enough. For example, you buy a cloth like Nike's coat. You need to pay from 100 to 200 dollars that you can buy one. This price is very excepensive, you couldn't do any thing about the price. If you want to buy, you need to save 2 or 3 month that you can buy one.    Now this problem become more and more important. Most of them couldn't earn more money in my city. So half of them will go back to their city to looking for a new job. But that couse the other problems. For example, a compeny who hiring a lot of people. They use a lot of time to training them. But when they finish training,  about half of them who ask resign and come back their city. It's waste company's time also waste these workers' time. For me, that isn't a good thing for everyone.     All in all, my city is very beautiful and busy. Now my city likes ShangHai and BeiJing become more and more developed. But the workers become a big problem now. So, in cerently year, my city's government give more and more advices about our wage to all the companies. They want to attract more and more young people come to my city to help us build our city.

In Sao Paulo, we have a lot of problems with robbery and all the kinds of crime, what makes us unconfortable and insecure to walk in the streets. You can walk talking on your phone without feeling the fear of someone stelling it, or drive next to two guys in a motociclye. Sao Paulo it is a huge city, with all differents types of people. Since the poor ones to the most rich people of the state. That difference is one of the biggest causes of these crimes in my city. Other cause is the government, who doesn't know how to give the money to the population and they are always charging us a lot of money in the taxes to use as a benefit for themselves.To resolve that problem, we need to change some people in the presidency or in the government. Unfortunelly, Brazil has a lot of problems with corruption, which cause a lot of problems not only in Sao Paulo but also in all the states in Brazil. We need to change a lot of things to help our country and after that, our states. Now that I'm not living there, I have any idea of what it is happening and what the population can do to change it.

We played acoustic guitar together and did sing together wich was awesome because we love to sing and play some instrument!","In Brazil we found  a lot of opportunities to grow up. Is not  only a country of soccer! One of the most improvement of my city and my Country is a program called FIES that allow the poor students to get a College because in Brazil the universities are so expansive, about 10,000 reais, wich is 2,000 dolars monthly. So that is the better improvement for the people in my age because everybody wants to study at a good University.That is a good program that can help the person that do not have change to grow up to study and be better than his parents, talking about the work.In other hands to rich student, is not great idea because de poor person take away his vaga at college. But in Brazil we have some great public universities too. Is not easy to get there but if you do not want to pay and do not want to try FIES you have to study preaty hard to get public university.Brazil will be a great Country to foreign people but immediate these program allows the poor Brazilians to get a more hope.",3.26W16 Placement,24340,"I love so much when I live.

Bogota as capital must resolve all problems that has, because in this city there are a lot universities and many students look for Bogota for begin their studies because this city has the best universities of the country, for all these reasons must improve their movility. for example when i studied in Bogota i spent 2 hours to arrive at my university because the traffic was terrible and the bus was very expensive i spent 5 dollars everyday only in buses. This is a terrible situation for one student because he must worry for study, for spend money, for movility of the city and it is not appropiated.

Therefore, organization is a big thing in this imporvement. There are many bus companies, so I have to conbine all of companies. Then, arranging routes. As result of that, drivers do not have to drive in same line, people will be more safe. For this reason, the car accidents will decrease in my city.However, when the buses and cars have their own lines, the traffic will become faster that improves entire traffic.     Many people who live in the rural areas usually say that they do not have enough bus stops, so they cannot take public transportations, that does not impover theri lives such as saaing time from home to work. Thus, setting more bus stops in rural areas that gives them more options to take public transpotations. They even live in rural areas can save much time through public transportations.      In conclusion, improving bus system and public transportations are very helpful in my city.

Because of all company do not hire them, they don't have any job and also let them decide to not marry and have children. it brings our country's motors get down and make it not lively. bad things happen round.So i suggest to make a rule about some percentage of hiring young adults to company that not try to employ young people. That make a help for starter to have more oppoturinty to learn more about what they want. One reason to not hire young people, The company expect them hire skills and educations like speaking english. they also don't want to spen more money to teach them. That makes young people to spend more time and money to be ready what the company ask them. But i am not disgaree this situation. When i worked for chemical company to make plubber list for 3 month, i don't have any backgrounds about chemical but i can learn how to read the map and how to work there. it took a short time to learn these things. Accoring to my experience, i learn why company needs more inventment to young adults. They just need to how to work and more real experience to help company. If they invest to teach them and more hiring young age help both young people and company.It will help to not only employeer that already hiried have more flexible work time to spend their life, but the company will make money to rasie young people in a long term. and definitly, young people can be emplyed.

It's very important that people of my age should know were do they come from, who were their ancestors and what things had been sacrifice so we can live and have the things we have right know. At my country, people my age usually complains a lot of its country and many of them, or in this case, many of us don't know our country history in detail. Many of its national culture had been lost because in the city is trying to replace the modern with the antique, and it doesn't have to be like that. Modern and antique culture should be combined. Making this combination we would be able to adapt to new changes without loosing our culture and respect for our ancestors. I think more museums should be created, history should be strenghten in schools, love for their country and respect for it should be teach to the children by their parents.  There should be opportunities were young students can work for these museums and learn from them. Books about tales and stories from our ancestors should be accesible for the public. Contests of paintings, poems or stories from our past should be done, so people could get exciting of investigating and to know about our past in creative ways. In the supermarkets, the sales of other countries holidays should be less and sales from country holidays should increase. One example; instead of two corridors full of candy and masks for halloween (wich came frome Europe and the USA) ; they should have corridors full of flags, lanterns and typical customs for  the national independence holiday.  I think that if we improve in these aspects, people my age will start loving more their country. They would be proud of it but most important , they will fight to maintain these traditions and culture, because they have develop a deep love for it. Young people will start making the necessary changes and will start taking the right decissions so we can protect what we already have but also, to be open and be able to acept new technology to fulfill the modernday necessities. Also many of the nowadays political problems in my country could be resolved, because knowing about the past will help us to know wich things were useful and good in the past and wich things were catastrophic to our contry, speaking in political terms; and so we , the next generation, could be guided by these things and principles. I think that knowing about the past and to love it, either way it has been good or bad,  will help us to learn from our mistakes , learn about good principles and fund our culture in those good principles so we can have a better and faster growth in all the aspects of our life; but the most important thing about thats is that thanks to that we , the young adults, could be part of that big and good change.",3.34W16 Placement,10330,"I'm married so I live with my family. I have 4 children . My eldest son returned from a Mission  in Uruguay  and then he came to the States to study at BYU, he's 21 and is an excellent man. Then comes my daughter who is 20, she was studing at BYU but now she is going on a mission  to Brazil, she likes sports a lot and and she is very friendly and talkative. Then comes Javi, she is 15  and she is likes fashion and make up, she is a litlle shy but a very good friend and she is so creative.

My husband is a very hardworking man who is always doing things in order to improve our lives. We do things together.","My city needs many things to be improved to be a better place to live in. One of them is pollution. Santiago has become one of the most polluted cities in South America which brings negative consequences to our helath and habits. If this could be solved people of my age could practice outdoors sports more frecuently. There wouldn't be so many respiratory illnesses specially in winter; there would be more outdoors activities and some scheaduled ones wouldn't be cancelled because of bad air conditions. In some parks there are many kinds of gyms for people to do excersise for free but many times air conditions do not allow people to use them so finally they prefer to go to an indoor gym to excersise but not all the people have the money to afford it. Others like doing running so you don't need to pay a gym for that but when the air is so polluted, authorities prohibit to practise any sports outdoor. Some people of different goverments have tried to solve this problem but all of them have failed. The solution is not simple, the city is located in such a place surrounded by mountains which do not allow the air move quickly so  pollution is, in a way, stucked in the air. A long time ago, one candidate to the presidency proposed to dinamite some mountains to solve the problem but that idea sounded crazy and it was desestimated. People of my age need to do some excercise and we have beautiful parks to do it. If this could be solved we will be very happy sto do sports because that is so good for everybody's mood. When someone practices some sports he/she feels better, happier and more willing to do good things, you better relationships and want to do share and do things to improve yourself. Besides, when people of my age practise sports they are teaching others through their example that sports are good for everyone. Pollution is something difficult to solve but I really hope that it could be done soon for everyone's sake.",3.34W17 LATs,97372,"My roommate is a Japanese girl. She has long, black hair.

Of course there are many schools, but after graduation, I can't enter the building.

However, It is always difficult to find place to study feeling comfortable. I used to go to a studyroom in my school when I was a student. I liked the place because all people there were studying and I could consentrate with studying in that environment. Even after I graduated from college, I always had something to study for my life. There are some libraries in my city, but the study place was small, always  busy, and full of older people. I felt uncomfortable with it.     So, if there are more places to study for people for my age(22-30), I would love to go and many young adults as well, I think. There are just tables and chairs, some PCs and books in huge space. Young people can use it until midnight for free. There is a board to exchange information, such as finding friends who have same interests. So that young adults in my city can interact each other in their private lives.     As a conclusion, I think if there are more places to study for young people, it wold make my city a better place to live for people my age.

We must take a bus or subway, but averypeople are using this transport (subway and busses), teenagers, olders and every people, so the subway and busses are fullfilled. Students should live close to university like here in provo or U.S. Therefore the student just walking to the university and they come back to the apartament in a few minutes. And they could come back to them home with them families every weekends. The inmmediate potential is that student will have more time for his responsabilities and they will be less angry and more happy. And long-term consequences are that students like will be less angry they will study more happy and them scores in the university will be better than before. With students more happies and with more time the countre where they lives will be more succed because the student willbe more succed and more happy. Another reason is that in Chile the people is more inmmature than U.S. people because the youngmen get out from his houses when they are 30 years old generaly, and they living singles in his apartamen or with his roommates, they will must to be more independents, therefore they will be more mattures. I hope that in Chile some day the people will be more happy like Provo people.

In my country, most of students learn new knowledge only from textbooks, and seldom to do real experiment and explore the knowledge they have learned. And the only one destination of learning knowledge is to pass the test. I think it's a terrible phenomenon. People just know those theories of  their of their major but they are not able to do anything when they face to the  situation they have to use their professional knowledge. That's the education let them suffer from this kind of  problems. And it also causes students don't understand what major they really like. So there are many students are learning something they don;t really interest in. This make them run from school, run from what they are enforced to learn. Because of that students just learn to test, and their parents also very care about their exam scores in the school, many students will are enforced to go to cram schools after school. Most of schools begins at 7 a.m. finish the daily school schdule at 5 p.m. then they have to go to cram schools until 9 or 10 p.m. and then go home to do their assignments from school and go o bed about 1 a.m. day by day. They don't have their own free time to do what they really want to do, even exercise. it's harmful for health, many school works and no exercise. Even the PE class time could be cancel and take the time for math calss. I hope my country could learn more from American education.

However, there is not job opportunities for everyone in city.One improvement that I think would make the city a better place is if we had more job opportunities that would allow us to make the city a better place.First, if students had such jobs that not only would allow them to earn, but sort of help them to get an experience, and also be intertaing it would cause more students to be more dilligent.For example, If I study chemistry and like and want to get a job associated with chemistry, I could try become a teacher's assistent. But What about the rest of my classmates? If we all had an opportunity to work in labs and get paid for this, we would not knew chemistry better, we would also get the experience we need, would more likely love what we study.Second, knowing that  there are lots interesting and entertaining jobs make us to be more excited and happy.There are lots of students who don't what to feel like they do boring things,  but if  there are more available options of doing fun things and getting paid for it definetely makes them excited.

To resolve this problem I think the governement should make a survey about what  student learn more in college and create condition that other people can invest their money in the country to facility people to find job.    After college many garduate students don't work on their major because  they can found job that related to it. A survey will be the easiest way for the governement to know in what those student are graduate from. This list of questions will  give the answers. For exemple, many person in my country study something relevant to economy like accounting or mannagement but after that they can work on in because the jobs are limited. In this case they find out an ohter job. If the government know that it will be easy for them to create job related to this branch.    The governement is not the only sector to create job but their are some condition that help other people to invest. The environment should be peaceful . If the environment is insecure people won't invest their money because they should lost their money in  one day.For example if they know people can put their investment one fire they won't come.Itis one of the best way to create new jobs when other people invest. In this case the condition should be one point for those who want to invest heir money and it is the task of the governement.      Find out the range of people who study what and favorise other people to invest are two improvement that would make a big difference in my country.Those changes will be benefit for people in my age because that will hepl them to find beter job and they will be able to take care of themself.

Also  find a building owners who sale their room too much expencive and make them not to do these things.If this happens, college students can consentrate with there major studies and their familly who helps them financially can get rid of financial stress.This would be a huge potential power for my country to be more powerful.",3.65S17 Placement,69161,"I lived with my entire family, my mother, my father, my older sister, my grandmother, my husband and my daugther.

I have a lot of interests and writing novel is one of them. By the way, that's my favorite hobby.  I started to write some short story when I was 9. In fact , it's a chance to stary my writing life. I just watched Harry Potter.The new world , new person, different life. That's alll you can create. After that I start to write.

In that case, the first big problem is  Traffic Jam.  For example, if your work time is 8:00 am, and you get up at the 7:25 am. And if you have no traffic problem the office go to your homes'  time is ten. In that case, if you live in Beijing,  you should realize one thing that is  you already late.  Through out of all street you can see cars  take the all space an they all wait to move. LI Mei who is a QingHua University professor did a data caculate.  Beijing have three hundred thousand people whose were  lived in other state work in Beijing and they almost leave in Spring festival to come back home. And that's why the Beijing have those big traffice problem.   So what should we do?  I think the first thing is to control the population input or output. Beijing is a Urban and now it's a Internet age. People can spend a much time in their home to use computer  to figure out works. You don't need  spend your lot of time on your trip to go your office and work on the computer. If we control those type of people and make them work at home. I think the traffic will be better. Second, I think we should build more high way or bus station. Normaly, you can see many personal car stay at the street. Some People have enough space to park their car. Some of them will park on the street. That will make street to be crowd. We should build more bus stay and encourage people to use it.

So, for this reason and others goverment need to improve quicly a new law for spend more time with our families.     There are many possitive effects in the society to spend more time with your family. One of the most common problems in the society is that some parents work the all day, in consecuence more of them don't have enogh time for play with his sons, the result of it is more of this children's are playing alone in the street and learning somithing bad for his life.  For example, in my city the law say that you need to work for 45 hours each week, the problems of this is the money that you earn is not enough for your necesities so more parents have two jobs. in consecuences his children's are playing the all day in videos games or playing in the street.  but if the goverment change the law, and give two or more hours for law for share with your children's it s a fact our society change for do better. may be more of our chidrens are doctors or a good influence in our society because his parents teach them a good principles at home. In conclusion, the time you spend with your childre's can produce a good effects in his life and our society.     The Profets in our time said, that the time in family is one of the most important thing for differents reasons. First, the profets in the last days always remeber us the important is the family in the plan of God, They said, that you can earn more money and be rich, or you can be a excellent teacher in the school, but if you lost your family, you lost all in your life and this have bad effects for the eternity. In constrast, the said, if you raised your children's in light and true when They be adult they are a good influence in the society and the Church. For example, one of my best friend, his parents have a lot of money because they work the all day, But They never receive the soppourt that he needed and in the final he was a smoking droug  and lost his life. in conlusion, the profets know about the problems in this time, for this reason is important that the president of our countries follow the word of God in our days because the time in family is one of the most important thing in this life.     In conlusion, the time you spend with your family is one of the most important things you can do, but is important change the law now, we need to spend 2 o more ours with our childrens if we want a better society.",3.68F15 LATs,20410,"I am living with an awesome guy. hes name is Memo and he is from Mexico. memo is some of my best friends and we meeted 8 months ago.

Most of them are good places to live and improve lifes. Some cities have not good ways to help people to grow in them enviroment. One improvment that Lima City can do for people that have my age is to have more oportunities to get a good education. There are two ways to improve the education in Lima City. The first one is to have good schools with prepare organitaton for the education and the second one is to have exellents teachers in the schools. Education is the best way to improve the life of the people and all the young people can change their mains or acts to be better and be successful.The first point to improve the education in Lima City is have good schools. To have good schools means to have some factors that will help to students have more knowledge and have a good vihavior. Some schools in Lima City have old infrastructure and these schools have not good organitation to help the students and teachers to get a good level to learn and to teach. In other word the schools need be prepare with good extrategies as soon as the requirement of the others schools in other countries.The second one is to have exellents teachers. An exellent tecaher is no only who is nice with the students. A good teacher is who is prepared in all the way to help the students. Be a good profetional is a good indicator that all the teachers in the school will are exellents to teach. To have many evaluations will help the theacher to feel prepared and ready to teach in any material that them will teach. Furthermore teachers are a principal factor to help the students have a good academic life and in this way if the schools in Lima City are prepared to have good oportunities to share good skills to the young people Lima willl be a better place to study.To get education some times is a privilage. Young people in Lima City have options to study, but most of the schools are not prepared very well to satisfy the need of the life when students need to get a good job, because the level was low in the schools. In conclision one improvement that would make Lima City an exellent city is the good education in their schools. have good education is have good profetionals in the rigth way.",3.68W17 LATs,88226,"I star to live in oregon since june 2016 .

The sport area open the oportunity to most young people and families spent time toguether, this benefic the socciety because people goint o be more strongs. If the sport areas be free, more young people be interes in use this places, usually the ones places in my country cost money and students in my city dosen't had money. They are use a bat place to practice a skateboart and only some  people had the oportunity to practice a artistical  activities. Usually practice soccer because they can practice this sport in werever site.The oportunity to make more sport areas is the principal goal of my mather. My mother was spending time helping the comunnity to gey this areas. She only can get one soccer place, this had a good conditions and also was free to used. Some people to usually spend time made bat activities now they are practice soccer, and the level to insecurity dow notable.One of this proyect include no only sport place, this spand the oportunity to made a artistical place to people use free and some of the artistical person in the  comununity have the oportunity no share they skill or abilities, same to service. Many citys have the same challenge and they only used more police and try to improve the security with more vigilance.

For example; The use of computer labs is wonderful idea for help to students in their homework.     Second, This idea will help more people be prepared that means have the capacity or necesary knowledge to help others. Some of teachers will need take some courses and to have the recent information about that. It will create more opportunities to increase their jobs.

If we go more deepley, every city in a country is distinguished from another. To make this differences, the government has to be thinking all the time new projects that will make grow his city. There are several projects that the government can introduce and create, such as better security, less corruption, and more transit impriovements. However, the best option that the governor of my city can do is to inmprove the education because with better education will call the attention for several students, making the economy of the city arise.Education is really important for each teenager. Sometimes, youth decide not to study, but to start working. However, if my city encourage people to study, and construct a better university will catch the attention for more youth. When we have more students in a city, that are stuying,  we can see that this city will be younger than if they are not students. This is very important because youth have a energy to make a city grow, making it an active city. Also, getting a great job is difficult because of the competition that exist. Students look for universities that can help them to overcome that competition, and have a better future. Ergo, if my city improves his education system, will call the attention of the students and create a better environment for youth people.Having a better university, the economy in my city will increase. When we have more students coming, it will be easier to offer jobs and help these student to pay their school than a city that does not focus in education. BYU is a great example of a university where students all around the world can come and enjoy a great educational environment. When an international student arrives, for example, he has the opportunity to work on campus and earn money to sustain his expences. If they can find a job in a place where they can study according to their schedules, it will cause a better impact in people of my age, and the city will have more people to work. If we start teching our students to work while they are studying, their responsibility skill will develop, and the economy of my city will increase.Therefore, the arise in the economy, where more money can be invest in other projects, and the suggestion of a better university will help my city to grow. For these reasons, improving the educational system will help more than other project, where students will feel better and have more confidence in their future. If every city and government focuses in education, the world will have less problems, and everyone will feel unity.",3.76W17 LATs,14620,"I used to live with my siblings last semester, but now I am living with rommates.

It is important to research information and help as a society a better place to live. I want to explain two reasons why it is important to change this abit to make my city a better place. First, the envaronment is an important thing to think becuase will help you to make your city a better place to live. When we learn in our house to stay the house clean when we will  in our city we can continue with this habit. For example, if you learned how to continue clean your house when you go to the park even though is a public place you want to stay the park clean and if you used it when you finish to play you will want to leave the park clean. Second, simple because is the place where you are living.  This is a good thing to think becuase when you learned how to recycle you will help as a society to make your city a better place to live. Sometimes we think that it is not important to recycle, but this simple action can help you to make your city a better place. For instance, when you want to go to the park we like to see the park clean and we can help as a society to continue it is simple to take out the trash that we did and this action can help to be a good example to the society.  In conclusion, one thing that I would like to change in my city to be a better place to live is the pullition. Even though, some times we think that it is impossible we need to start with us and if you are a good example to the society we can change to be a better person. We can start to recycle and try to continue clean the public places as a parks or libraries etc.  Whit this small things we will the difference in our city.

In a few weeks she will leave to her mission. She likes to hike and practice extreme sports. My other roommate is Aleena. She also is at BYU.

My roommates are awesome.","In my country a lot of young people get dissmised from private schools because they do not have pay the tuition. And in public schools students  don't get always a good education. So, wether you are in a public or private school is difficult to keep sudying. By the loss of oportuinites, because as they can see that in the present don't have the resources they may think that also in the future will be the same. So one improvement that my city would make to help and bring benefits to the young people is to give more opportunities to get scholarships no matter what kind of school youth are enrolled so students  will be more interested and in the long term, government will have to create more jobs.First of all, young people will be more interested on their studies. Sometimes they want to have a motivation to continue studying. And get goos scholarships is difficult and a lot of times these are denie to most of them. So, they get sad becuase now they woul not have the monet to still paying. And for this reason they decline them studies. So, is its more accessible to get aids to keep sitdying they will be more interested.Secondly, in the long term government will need to create more jobs and the economy will grow. This is like to make pressure to the governors and the work system. As they can see first the high demand for people that want to study they will need to create more schools and with this more land to work. In the future all this people that wanted to study and already finished now they need to get a job. And also the system will be forced to bring jobs to them. In summary,  people will be more interested on their studies and one consequence in long term is that government will need to create more jobs. With this, young people will have better opportunites not just for their present also for their futures. And this opportunites will not affect only young people also the economy is going to be benefit for the changes they will have to make.",3.77W17 LATs,17261,"I lived in Mexico with my family.

She the most of the time is in my house and now she is with my two sisters. Ashley is my younger sister and she is really atletic. She plays hockey and tennis because She said those sports do a remember of me. Then is my other sister Ximena, she is the yungest, and she is now 8. She is in basic school and she loves sing. She plays sports, but she didn't choose one for play like a professional. Those people can discribe how was my live in Mexico before I came back here. They taught me about administration, how I can survive, how is love and how live. I love all my family.","My country where I borned is Mexico. Mexico is a country really big and this has a lot different types of weather. The people there are friendly and all time there are exited about how they can live. The life is more fast than here, and it's more poor because we are a third world country for the economy. The people between 15-30 is the most active and faster I know. Those try always to progress, but sometimes they don't have the opportunities to life really well. They need to start work before the aproperty age, and they need to try to support their siblings and their family in a really short age. First if we want to change, we need start with a reminder like in the church. We should start with a little changes, for example: We can change the education, and we must try defending our country, without racisism, wihtout standars or thoughts about what they should do. We must change the expectatives of the people who live wiht you. Second is important improve the houses and places where the most people go, It's important change the activities for the youngest people and how they see the live. We can start offering opportiunities to learn differents things, for example: a language, a sport, an art, It doesn't matter the type of things, but the point and how we will do is the really important thing. If you are here you should now this is going to down a lot because is not easier change a country in one day, It's not easy change a mind of a thousands or millions people, but you have to continue in your way, you need to stay on your feet and don't move. But you must take care about how you teach because the examples are the really form to start the change, you need money, yes, but it's not the most important. The education is the key to move, to try to be better, to change. Education can be difficult in the first, but  this starts in our homes, in our childhood. when we born, when we think the most beautiful in our lives is only the sun, and his lithg. The education is not the form which you can keep quiate the children, and you can take care while the patents are working. It's the form that the children can learn, and they can know how will  be the live, how they need to be, but I don't say is about the geography or matematics, It's about the humild, the peace, the love, the service. Improve will not be easier, but this can be possible in a future, for our grandsons, but If we really  want to improve my country we need to change first the mode how all world do the values, and that start in the education, and then progress in the economy, transacctions, in the form of administrations an all.

If I need to think about a plan to makes really benefit this city for this kind or people, I suggest places where students can go and relax in the campus; something recreative. I think that we need something like that because everybody needs to stay focus all of the time in our studies.  Taking in count that you can see that it isn't health for us have a lot of the stress. If we have stress we can't work very well. For example, I was studying during 2 weeks for final test. Obvously I going to stay compleatly tired with a lot of frustrations, but if there is a place to relax in the campus, I can go there and forget everything in my life and the next minutes or hours I can stay better like a new person prepared to start studing again.

Malls all over the world help people to enjoy visiting it. A bigger Mall in Provo would help people to enjoy more going to it . Even though some people may think that Malls are bad places to visit, Malls create  good eviroments where people can go as family and spend some time together. A Mall in Provo can be beneficial for different reasons. Some of those reasons are that family would have a place to visit together, and fun places would be closer to visit. .                           Families do not have a lot of places to visit together. Malls create that enviroment to families to go and spend time together. In a Mall families can visit different stores for the different preferences of the family in the same place. For example, in a Mall children can visit a store for chilchen, or they can go to a game store. Due to that Malls have stores very close to each other, family can go and visit cloth stores that are close to the games stores. For that reason, Malls are a good place to help families create closer relationships.  .                            Second, fun places are all over of most cities. Families have to drive to different stores if they want to satisfy the preferences of all the family. At a Mall, families would have everything close. They would not have to spend big amounts of money to visit different stores that the family want. For example, if family want to get icecream, play laser tag and they want to do both thing, they would have to drive to get icecream and after drive to a laser tag store. To resume, in a Mall families would have many fun places to visit without need of driving arround.  .                             In conclusion, a Mall in Provo can ve a very good place to improve the social enviroment of a city. With a Mall in Provo, there would be more people happy, and more people would have a place to relax on weekends. It is strongly recommended to build a Mall in Provo because it will benefit many familes and friend relationships. If a Mall is not built in Provo, families and friends would still have to spend much time driving to different places to find fun things to do.",3.81S17 Placement,27887,"I used to live in France with my husband.

You take like 45 minutes and sometimes an hour to cross two bridges. And frequently without traffic you can cross the bridges in just 10 minutes. But the point is that it will help to save time and  polution decreased by morning and evening.First  we always need time in our jobs  to finish an specific task and stuff, so for workers it can give him more time to spend with his family and maybe to return to home for something they forgot in a hurry. Also it's better for students. I was studyng engineering in Electronic and Telecommunications in Guayaquil at Espol University and I took three hours to go and return at home. But with a new brigde it would take just 2 hours. There are similar cases like this with many students and workers in my city. So all of us would be benefit.Another point to build this bridge could be with a long view to decrease the pollution by morning. Even by night there are many cars  and contamination for the noise of the cars. So our health could be better too. In conclusion to build a new bridge can help my city with the commercial activity, health and saving time.

Thy useally at the apartmet during the lunch time because they all have class in the early morning, and they don't have class at 11:00 to 2:00. So, we eat lunch together at the apartment. They help me to do my homework. They teach me speaking or writting. They are so kind with teacing.       theyare so funy. we watch korean dorema with my roommates. we have fun time evry day","There are lots og law which have to change because some times it makes us hard to live. I think rise the age that people can be adult is good to improve my age for many reasons.             First, people can be adult when they turned 20 years old in Japan. I am 18 years old, so I am still child in Japan. So, I need a parents permission if I get some licences, go to the school, and get the job. Requrement the parents permission is so stressful to us because we can do evrything ourselves, but we have to talk to parents what i'm doing right now, and why I need a permission.  If the law changed, we would have many chance to do something new because we can do evrything without parents permissions.         Second,it is very hard to get a parents permission people whose parents have already died, or treated them  bad.  I think gorvement have to think about those people, and meke them that they can get permission easily because the children have to find the person who can be their parents eventhough they are 18 or 19 who can live themselves . I think it is hard to get the permission to them.             Third, if the law changed, and people who are 20 or more old, people wold have a responsability for everything. I think 18 or 19 years people in Japan don't have responsability for many things. They think that their parents help them, and they are still child, so if they made some mistakes, it would be okey because they are child. Therefore, if the law changed and people who are 18 and older  have to live themselves make teennager having a responsability for every thing because they have to live themselves.         Because of it can get a chace to do new, can be stressful, and responsabilities, I think the law have to be changed. I think peoople who are 18 or 19 can live themselves. It makes people have a responsabilities for every thing, and Japan would be more better country because young people can get many chances to secsees.",3.83F15 LATs,41411,"I living here for a year and I know different people in this time, most of they was students and some of their has finished their mayor and are working.

Every day are several tons of garbage that people produce, and this is a growin problem in every country. Furthermore, increase this problem the less education that people has about recycling. According several studies making in different parts of the world, the principal factor of contamination are plastics, some solucion could be educate people the way how recycling, and educate people to put garbage on the right places.Firts, educate people how they need to recycling could be the best solution in long term because people can use again the same products. For example, plastic bag,  people get plastic bag when they are bying on the supermarket, people can save this bags and use the next time when they go to shopping, another example could be   paper at the college or university. Student can use both side of the paper in place of only one. In addition, people could find different ways how use chothes or cardboard making different thing for decoration. This kind of thing helps people to develop their creativity skill.Next, educate people to put garbage on the right places is a solution that could be take time and patience,  also need the government helps because most part of the city doesnt have specific places when people could be put garbage. In conclusion, contamination is difficult because not only depend of have a organizer city is about culture and educated people and suport of the government.

We need to know that making changes in the world it is hard but it is important to have a better life with a good segurity of life.One thing that I will put in all the world is that everyone is able to use guns. In a world where the violence is in whatever place, the thieves usually steal things using guns and sometimes they kill people, but if everyone can use them, that means that the thieves are going to thing twice if they want to want to steal something to someone else. if someone is going to kill os steal someone else, that person is putting his life in risk because everyone can use guns too, such as in The united states. Everyone can use guns konwing the consequences if someone is going to steal or kill to someone else. That idea will bring more segurity in the lifes of people.Another idea I will put its create more places to recycle  trash that we throw away. There are many trash we can use to create new things. That idea will bring new ideas to do not throw the trash and using to do other good things. That will cause less trash and new ideas to use again the things that maybe we are not going to use again.Finally, my last idea will be to put especific places to smoke. There are many people who like smoking all the time, and they do not think about the consequences about that. To keep up a beautiful places we need to take care them, such as forests, flowers, and others more. That will bring more green places to play something, more trees where animals can live and other good consequences. All the world have similar problems, and doing a change is a little hard because we need to do all together such a team.

This is very improtant to my age.                    First, my age is 24 so many people want to get a job. My same age people learn more about thier major. Why they learn more about their major? This is my anwser. They want to get a good job. They always try to get a job ,but it is very difficult. For example, many people doesn't get a job in Korea. If you are graduated your school, you must find a job but job is not enough. They want to work but they can not work.

Everything there is expansive not only paying university but also everything that a student needs. That is why people of my age still living with their parents so they can save money and even that sometimes it is not enough.The improvement is to the goverment would help students to pay for it and the university give schoolership to students that are good. Other thing is they could build apartments close to the university that could also fit in their buget and that could help them save money of gas or bus, because they could walk to school.That would make their life a lot more easy and would help a lot.

In my country we are a small country we make a lot of electrionic product to sale all the world.  Most of my friends or classmates we are electronic eingeer. We are requested to work a long time, because they are a lot of work for engineer. I think it's not fair. However we already have the law to limit the working hours. But most the company doesn't follow the law. So the reasons for me to modify the law for working hour limit to help my conutry become a better place to live are family problem, healthy problem, creation.The first reason for me to modify the law for working hour limit to improve my city to become a better place to live is family problem. If the husband spend to much time at work will make the devorce rate raise. Working to long damages the family, because husband do not have much time to deal with their wife and children to show his love. Father needs to spend time at home.The second reason for me to modify the law for working hour limit to improve my city to become a better place to live is healthy problem.If the worker works to much time everyday will cause death rate higher. Employee is the proporty of the company and working to much will damage the employee's health. If the employee die ,it is not good for anyone company or family or all country.So the government should set the woking time limit strick. The third reason for me to modify the law for working hour limit to improve my city to become a better place to live is creative. I don't think too much working hour will help the company to earn more money. The successful company they need the smart and creative employee. Not a stupid employee. If the employee he/she work too long. He is not happy for working, because he is too tired. His creativity for the company is low. In includion, to follow the low strickly is very important. To help the people at the country can have better family life, better health, and more creation for company, country, and family. So I strongly to suggest taiwan's government to do this process. The good way will help all country become more strong. If I can make a change to my country. I will modify the law of the working hour limit to make my country become a better place to live.",3.88F15 LATs,98448,"The diference between the people who are living with me now is a lot.

The available areas to pratice sports are in bad conditions. Some people prefer don't practice the sport because is dangerous.  The goverment doesn't do anything to try fix it. So the culture to practice sport in my city is almost lost.      I would implement areas to practice biking. The people who practice biking don't have the suficient space to do it. A lot of people had accident when they tried practuce it in the street. The streets in my country are very close. The people parking in all street so you don't have space to drive or do biking. I would fix it making the street bigger and putting a space where the people can bike. Another example is the space to play Futboll, they are in really bad conditions, a lot of plants in the space to play futboll. I would clean the spaces and mantein it in good conditions to practice that sport.      The basketball space is on better conditions than other spaces to practice another sport. The basketball is not popular in my country so the spaces to do that are good. But some children are insteresting in play that game, the problem is the space to play it doesn't has the correct space to children. I would make anothers spaces for children, it can help on increase the culture of sport on children.     Finally, I think the sport culture is important in every place. The sport can help in out health. If i help increasing that culture that could be great. Some people in my country  want practice that but they don't have the necesary or correct space to do it.

I'm sure that would be a good decision or way to help the young people in my city. Everyday there are people young looking to practice a sport, but there are not many opcions to choose one. Furthermore put in other way. I don't want to say that all the surffers are a druggers. There are many surffers who are good people doing very well their skills and I admire that. but there is a great risk for the amateurs who are starting with that sport. In the mean time would be fantastic seen young people reading more books in the libraries or that my state always are in the first places in all the sports competitions. And less young people addicted by the drugs and others stuffs who hurts them in a long or short time. In fact if the governament do something to help the young people in this fight against of the bad habits would be the best strategy to improvement in all the sense.

I am from Peru and I decided to live alone in a private room because is more confortable than to share a room, The house were I live is large and I live with a family from Mexico and with another family from Peru. They have their own problems to solve and they just work. I am the only person who is a student in that house.  In my opinion I live there with out problems about living because I have all my things in my room and never lost anything. When I arrived to my room I can study, sleep, eat, take a shower, turn on or turn off the ligth when ever I want. I do not have to face problems with anybody. In sum, I always prefer to live alone in a private room. Certainly, I have to pay a litte more money but it is good to be confortable.","As a matter of fact,  everybody wants to live in a city where everybody can live with out problems in order to live confortable. I am a man who works in an office of the government in Peru. I am a offcial of the Electoral Commision in my country. People who has my age and my status in my country ussually work and train in their professional abilities and they support their families. One of the things that in my country we need to improve is the way to avoid the rush hour in transportation from some place to another place in order to be confortable and share time with the family.It is very important to arrive on time to any appointment. Everybody feels better when he or she arrives on time to his or her job or any place. In the city where I live is really very hard to arrive on time to any appoinment because there are many vehicles in the roads and there are not many roads to arrive to the destiny. For example, if somebody works eigth hours per day and start to work at 8:00 am he has to left his house two hours before to arrive on time to his job. Then when that person finishes his job aproximately at 5:00 pm he has to face the rush hour again to go back to his home and usually he arives home at 7:00 pm. Sometimes, people study some course and it start at 7:00 pm until 9:00 pmand after that he could go back home. With this example it is easy to understand how inconfortable is to live in a city that has not many options to arrive from one place to other place in a short time because there are many cars and a few roads. All of the roads are full of cars in a rush hour. We spent more time out of home that with our families.In sum, It is true that everybody wants to live confortable, especially people who has my status and age that usually work and train in their professional abilities in my country, so  it is necessary to improve new means of trasportation in my city to avoid the rush hour and it is very important to design new roads to short distances betwen one place to another to be confortable and to have time to develop ourselves with our families.",3.9S17 Placement,48505,"I was living in my country Peru with my family.

We have a lot of music like Saya, Morenada, Diablada, Festejo, etc. It is not so simple because every song and dance have a story. In the highlands, Saya and  Morenada it is  a dance for the 'indios', 'cholos', 'negros' and 'serranos', names given for people from Spain, this people work all the day for food and in the night their dance represents the pain and how they think about the work and the death. They dance so rude and with clothes that represents the hell and the pain of their own people.Secondly the food and the buildings, you can eat more than fifty plates and a lot of drinks, we have some rituals and walks with 'Santos' for all the city, sufering the pain and the thoughts of our people. With a 'quena' in the hand, men walk playing songs, sad and happy songs, drinking alcohol or beer, going to the town crying, or just talking about something.The people are so nice and the food is kinda cheaper, we have a lot stories from the death or just telling parent to their sons, etc. For example Macchu Picchu, or Urus, how that cities were buildings and (one of my favorites) ghost, horror stories, and it is so nice to drink chocolate or some herbal tea, with your family, telling some story about 'Karisiri' or  the work or some activity. The family in my land it is so important therefore me and my mom are the best friends, she is my favorite girl and that kind of relationship it is the same for the rest of the families.

Probably there are many resources that we can use today to do better, but we do not know where to find them or how to use them. The city could help us to know more about this information, have more job opportunities and provide some benefits.The government wants to have succesfull people or youth, wants to have people in the future that will help them to improve and progress. For those reasons, they have a lot of  programs and help for us the youth. However, sometimes they do not provide this information in an effective way. The government know that htye have it, but the youth does not have a clue. If the youth does not know that those things exist in here, how are they going to use it?. If they do not use it, how does the city is going to progress? . Creating those things is not enough, they need to inform the people about it.Also, most of the times people or the youth have problems, they want to study and work at the same time. University is expensive. We have heard that the university or education is a thing that you have to have, but most of the times it feels like is it a privilage to have it, because of the prices.  For that reason, most of the students have to work at the same time they study. Sometimes this students does not have a great job and they need to work extra hours in order to be able to pay the university. If the governmet provide help finsing better jobs, the youth would have to worry less for the money and more in their studies. The life of a student is not an easy one. Maybe some of them do not leave with their families and find really hard to get use to all the new responsability that they have.  That could lead to a big amount of stress in one person and alot of stress can lead to many sicknesses. Moreover it could to depression and death. The government could provide some benefits or help to this part of the youth. Help in some aspects of their lifes.

People can do some changes in their cities to have a good life. Sometimes people think that they can do the change in the world, but actually they are the base to that worl get better. For example, if people are more frienship with others, if people are helpful, and if they are not  corrupt, they will get a better world.          If the people are more frienship with others they will be more king. For example, in many cases the people see frequentely their neghboors, but they have never talked with them and for that people do not feel comfortable in the place that they are living because they do not know anything about their neighboors. If they have more comunication with them, they will  feel comfortable.         If people are helpful with others they will get help too or they will feel better for their action. For example, most of the people need a lot of help and others know about them, but the people act that they do not know about their situation. For that the people sometimes is rude, but if people are kind and peoplehelp people who needs help until they do not ask you about that people will be more helpful.        If people are no corrupt our countries can get better because they will be honest. In these times, most of the cities acept money for do not be arrest from the police and that determinate the type of the people who you are ( poor or rich). If people do not do that we will be sameness and the goverment will change the things.         In my opinion, if people are more frienship with other, if they are helpful, and if they are not corrupt, they will have a better world.

Big cities usually have a lot of transportation, opportunities to get a job, many schools, and they can be an amazing place to live. However, cities need to be a safe place to live and the people need to feel it everywhere that they go. The solution is pretty easy and it is possible do it and can be even easier if the the population help doing little things, and there are some ways to do it.                      When people thing about living safety, it is common to think about home, sometimes living with parents, going outside during the day and things that make them feel safe. Nevertheless, they can feel in the same way if they live, for example, in small cities where they know everyone. It is possible too achieve that feeling if they develop this type of relationship with the neighborhood. Then, anywhere, even big cities, can seem such as home. People can do it for themselves, but the government has a big part of the job to do.                       The government of each city individually, has to promote an environment for the population no matter what. Policing should be the priority, to protect everybody and to motivate the population to do even more good actions to help each other. The money to pay more policing is a big discussion, but the budget to do it could be used to prevent people to go to prison and make a difference and prevent intead of just use the policing and jail as forms of punishment. Applying this method of life not only need a budget by the government, but also a good primary education to develop these ideas since they are children .                      If teachers can teach math, science, geography, history of country, they also are able to teach each student how to live with good behavior. It is not enough just teach about it in class, but if the community in each school promotes more examples of good behavior, they will grow up better and knowing how to react for different situations, that they could not know only living at home. It would be helpful since everyone has to be at the school for many hours weekly and for many years during the hasdest time of their lives, the teenager. Because it is at this time that most part of the felonies start in the society.                 As shown, these ways can help the city to be a better and saffer place to live. The little thigns that everyone can do is helpful, and each person in the city has an important thign to do to help the city to be safer.

So small, that there is no university there. Because of this young people usually leave the city right after the graduation from a high school.  It would be really helpfull if youth could have an oportunity to get high education there and to build their career. For now, none of these options are possible.One of the main benefit of having the university and job oportunities for yong people is that it can prevent youth from leaving the city. A lot of people would like to stay in the city, but they do not see any perspectives. Very often when people move to another city for a high education, they prefer to not return to their hometown. The reason is because they already have some job oportunities in a big city. Aso they do not see how their high education can be usefull in a small town.This is how it is become like a circle. There are not many people with education who can make some new companies where high education could be needed. On the other hand, people with high education prefer to not come back to our hometown because they cannot see how they can use their high education here.Having a university in our town might be salvaltion to this problem.

In addition, the qualified people wil leave the country looking for a different opportunity. The end result will be to lose these qualifiactions in the country that is in need for them. It negatively affects the future generations.I wish at some point this peroblem will get to end. I believe, this will give an equal opprtunity for all people, and the one who deserves will be the one who gets it. This will change the perspective of Jordanians toward their country. Moreover, this will encourage them to return back to their country because they believe that they will have the opportunity they are looking for. However, to be able to get the best out of it, then it is the government responsibility to put an end for all these actions. They should be serious and put penalties for whom who would thing to do it again.In conclusion, I believe that to be able to get our counrty into a different level then we should stop using connections to help us acheive our goals. We should work hard to deserve what we dream of. Otherwise, we won't find qualified Jordanians in my country any more.",3.94W17 LATs,62796,"When I was in my home country I lived with my parents.

I always wanted to change something there because Vyborg is very beautiful town, but it's durty and very old. I liveed there all my teens years and wanted to make this town a better place to live. I think that goverment doesn't have money to change a lot of things, but I'm sure that every person in Vyborg can help with that.   First improvement that would make my town a better place to live for people it's to respect old ancient buildings. Vyborg is very old town. Vyborg's castle was build in 1290 and it's still there. People should respect and care about this beautiful castle. A lot of people draw and do a lot of bad things that have bad effect to the whole town. People complain that Vyborg is very durty town but they do nothing to change it. They live in this and just continiue to complain.   Second improvement that would make Vyborg a better place to live it's to open more parks, thing for interapting people and places where you can do something fun. In Vyborg live a lot of young people and they don't know what to do. They have a lot of free time and they just sit at home. People need cinema, more restourants and comfortable parks to spend their time there. I'm sure that this stuff will change everything.  I believe that if people will have all this things, Vyborg will be a better place to live.

I have been living in Japan for about 2 years and 1 year in Canada. Considering my these expriences, I would like to say 'having good family support program' will help people my age to live better. One of oustanding which Korea suffer from is people are not willing to getting married nor having a kid after their marriage. This issue is globbally know n and other countries also trying to resovle this. Getting married late and not having a kid will cause 'Higher ratio of old generation'. So later, small group of young generation who lead economy need to support large group of silver generation.To resolve this issue, Seoul or Korea goverment needs to provide better family support program.  First of all, the culture of company needs to encourage marriage and having a kid. People are afraid of letting their boss know about their marriage or baby becuase of possible disadvantage of promotion. Especially for woman, using materity leave make them nervous that they might can not come back to work.Secondary, company or goverment need to improv baby care system. People in Seoul is sufferinig from finding baby sitters or finiding place for day care. Few companies has kid care program for their employees but most of companies are not. Day care program which goverment owns is very competiative to get in. There is a joke among people that we have to line-up at least 1 year before which mean before actually having a baby. Goverment needs to increse places to take care kids and to prepare better options to have baby care. Third,  companies need to encourage people useflexible working hour and evaluate their performance without any disclamination. People are staying at work for so long everyday in Korea. It seems like normal in Korea and sometime it looks like mandatory. This culture can not enourage our ages to have a family.  To let people feel that work environment support you to take care of family, this will enourage people to get married or having a baby after then. At this moment, we shuld not forget that not only allowing working on flexible hour but also there should be no disadvantage on their performance rating.I elebrated 3 exmaples what Korea can do better to make better plcace to live. My meaning of better place to live is 'the place family can live happily'. Theare could be better ideas.

Because of this people between 20-30 years old are professional and they have more energy to do a great job.In my city there are many people between 20 - 30 years old who do not have emplyment because petroleoum companies have such as employees people between 50-65 years old because they have the experience. Even though, they are people who have been the whole time working in the sector and they have the knowdlege, they are people who have had the opportunity to work for a long time in other companies and they have a financial stability. For example,  my friend graduated the last year, he is chemical engineer but it is difficual for him to get a good employment because he does not experience.Other reason becuase people between 20 -30 yearsk old should be more oppotunites to work in these companies is beacause they are more energy than senior people.

Example have the rule that the people can start drinking at 25 or so on. I think this is pretty huge problem in my country and my city. And the people in my age or my friends mostly now in Thailand, so after classes they will just go hang out and drink alcohol. Sometimes in the past they just went to the store and just could buy it, even though they couldn't but the people in the stores would just sold it to them. For me I don't think it's right to do not have the specific or the serious rules about that, and that effects lots of things. After my mission when I came back home I just really worried about my friends and lots of things around me and about their futures as well. After they all started to drink they don't think a lot about school or what they need to do in their lives. Some of them have the control about that, and some don't have that at all. So, if it could be real improvement in my country it would be great! I have been noticed a lot that this just changed my friends and the people around me. And if we have this real improvement the students can have more focus and more time to enjoy of their school and work, and after that they will get familier and they will just love the way they are with out those things. Not like right now that they think it's a trend and they have to do it, because the people at their same age doing so, or it seems so cool.

And then they all will have opportunity to touch with the Spirit while the missionaries teach and accept the Gospel and their whole entire life will be changed! They will have the great family, be what they want to be, and be about to success in their life.

However, other people think that it still needs improvement and what some people always claim is about tubes that the workers every year delay to finish fixing around five months. There are many reasons why workers have to finish early.First of all, there is traffic. It makes traffic because those those are huge holes. In addition the only reason why cars can transit there is because holes are placed in a side, hence the cars have only one roud to go. There are not many accidents but people still need to get to work at time and the broken rouds difficulted the cars to move.  Besides, it slow down the carsSecondly, people would become stressed. It would be easy to get stressed while everytime they have to see at the big holes in the roud because those holes at anytime could make a huge accident. Besides, being stressed never is a great signal for future plans like going to work or going to an important meeting. For instance, it is already stressing for a person to get stressed in the roud because sometimes there is traffic.Third, people are paying fee.

My roomates are Ryan, Joe and Alec. They are all from United States and are atudying in BYU. Ryan is in the nursing program and is working part time in a community hospital here in Provo. Alec, studies computer science and works repairing computers with one of his cousins. Joe is studying chemistry and is not working at the moment, but learning as much as possible according to him. Ryan works during midnight from 10pm to 6am, and Alec works all day depanding on how many computers need to be repaired. What I like about living with they three is to be able to practice my English, to know about their families, and to learn more about the country. Also, something I enjoy is the friendship we all have. We go shopping together, we go play soccer together, we go to church and some other activities together as well. There is something they three share in common, which is the interest in cars. They love cars, specially sport cars. I love these type of cars, and because of the same I spend time with them talking about brands, engines and changes on the new ones.

This is not be necessary for some people, but it is for those that do not have a car. This would surely help students to feel motivated, to get up earlier to get to classes on time, and to waste less money in gasoline.   Motivation is something many students lack nowadays. In fact, this is one of the main reasons students performance tend to be low sometimes. Having better student school transportation would be a reason to feel the desire to go to classes. Moreover, having more buses for university students in the city would be an improvement, specially for those that do not have a car. Also, students will feel better emotionally because transportation is a reason to complain for many of them.Getting up earlier is not an easy task for university students. There are some that feel discouragement when waking up earlier knowing that there is no bus and that need to walk far to get on time. Having more buses would be help students to get to classes in time. This is surely a reason to wake up earlier because everybody wants to get to classes on time, but transportation is a problem sometimes. Having better school transportation would save time for students to study more instead of spending the time walking. The more buses available for students, the less money spent on gasoline. Indeed, when the school transportation is reliable there is no need for students to use cars. By doing so, money is saved, which could be used for other expenses instead of gas. It is necessary to improve students transportation in the city. In conclusion, improving the transportation for students in the city would be a great change to motivate students, to help them to get on time, and to spend less money on gas. By doing so, students performance would improve and time will be used better. It is recommended for the city mayor to take actions on this and to implement these changes.

Two of them are BYU students and one is a UVU student. One of them is actually studying here in the ELC. I like to spend time with them because at the same time I get fun I learn english. Some activities that we use to do are to watch movies or go out to hicke mountains. We all like to play soccer  so each saturday we go to a field close to our house to play soccer with other friends. On sundays, we all go to the church together. When we return to home, we cook and we eat together too. I like a lot to live with them because they are very pascient with me because sometimes I can't pronounce the correct words in english. However, I try to talk with the in English as possible I can. Also, one of them served his mission in Mexico so he used to help me to translate the most difficult words for me. In contrast, two of them served them mission in Italy so sometimes they can't understand me very well. I think this is a great experience that I will never forget because I'm very happy to live with them.","One improvement  would benefit my city is a university like BYU. I am very impress of the BYU program. It has a lot of benefits for the students and a lot of programs to improve the students life. In my city, the universities programs are really bad. One principal reason that I think the education is not good in my city is because the universities don't take care of the student's life.                            When I was study in Mexico, I used to work half time in a trips crew in Cancun. Sometimes I was very short of time to do my homeworks and work. It was really hard to organize my schedule and at the same time work. A lot of students used to have the same problems than me. One of the principal problems in Mexico is the education because the majority of students prefer to work and leave the school. One day I was thinking about what if we can have a university where we can study and work . 'It would be awesome!', I thought. I was really worry about my future and of course , my friends' future.                Now that I am here in Utah, I see the BYU program and I think that we need the same in Mexico. Here the life style is different. Students are not worry because they didn't find a job or they can't pay the school. They are just focus in their job and homeworks. Here in Utah, all the students can have good education and work to get married and have a nice future. In contrast, in Mexico and other countries is harddest to do it.               However, I think in the future it will be great if the governmt build a university like BYU in Mexico. A lot of young people would get a better life style and they can have a better education. Also, if they can have a good education the country can improve in a lot of things. The industries will grow and all the country can have a better future.             In my opinion, I think the most important thing Mexico needs is a better education and opportunities to have a better job. Nonetheless, I just can study hard and work hard to help the people in my country one day.",3.98F15 LATs,64056,"When I was living in Atlanta, Georgia, I met one of the greater person that I never meet before.

It is located in the west part of the country, and it is known as a city of education. It has a lot of sightseeing, historical buildings and monuments all over the city but there is some things that people should improve there. The one thing that I miss and it would improve in in its sports life. In my opinion this city would better if they build more plce that is allowed to see or practice sports. I feel nowadays people do not really have time to have fun as much as they want. Sport centrums would be the best for people to spend they freetime after work or school. Life is very busy in every city just like in mine. Also, this city is a college city because a huge university located there which is very famous in the whole country.  People all over the country come to study there. Students will be more productive in their freetime  if they have something to do. Additionally, sports keep the body healthy, fit, and helps to focus on school work better. This kind of sport centrums can help the older generations as well. They can keep their youth longer and become healthier in their age. This sport centrums sould allow to see professional soccer, tennis, team handball or basketball games. It is important that poeple contain sport in their life. It does not mean that they only can do sports, they can watch it. It is a good time spending activity to young people and old ones as well. Also, it helps the families to spend more time together and focus on having fun with each other. In the current life it is really hard to make it, but with these activities everything would be easier.  I feel like people would be happier and more satisfy with their life having more sports in their life. These kind of activities helps to improve people's life sytle and mood. Having a sportcentrum would make poeple's life better through being active in sports and having fun watching live games on the field. Sport is one of the best way to get rid of stress and anger. People should creat these kinds of centrums that allows students and families to get together and having fun throughout the week.",3.99W17 LATs,22660,"I have been leving with defferent people in the past year. when  I came here The United States 2 years ago I started to look for an apartment.

She works at the Marriott Hotel at 8 am to 2 pm, monday to friday. She is so funny person she always makes me laugh when I am with her, also she has adrenalide all the time.

One of the improvements is a better educacicion. Educaction is always important, but in my city i know that is has to improve. There are three main reasons such as people would have a better oportunities to work inside or outside of the contry, another reason is to manager the time doing sometthing productive, and the last reason educacion makes people more knowlegde. For these three reason I thing Educacion would improve my city makes it better place.First reason to have a better opportunities  to have a job inside or outside of the country.  why this reason would makes it a better place specialy people at my age, let me explain it in example. In Choluteca, that is my city, is difficult to find a job even if you have a majer in somthing, why? beacuse there are other people that has more educaction or the university where graduated are from the capital, so the companies give to them the jobs because they thing that the education outside of the my city is better than inside. Second reason, Eduaction is a good way to  teach people to manege thier time. For example, when I was in vacationes is difficult for me to do something productive every single day because when I am at school the majority of my time I spend it at school or doing homework. If people stay at home doing nothing  that make a place not good as it could be. In adition of that people that is productive can chage their life and because of that the place change. Thrid reason,  education makes people more knowlegde.  For example, there are two times of people, people that go to university and people that decied not to go.  There are many reacherses that explain that people that educate, their life is better that people that do not educate.  Is not about the city, is about the people that live there that make it better and change in a good way. If people have knowlegde about what is happening around them it would be easier for them to be aware about it and to know the solucions of some problems. Finanly, For these three manin reason I thing that a better Education would make my city a better place. In the future my city it would be better because people would have more opportunites to work in the companies that my city has and people would be more productive so that means that my city it would be too. I know that there are more reasons, but Education is going to be the principal for me, if  one city want to change it has to improve the education and the result of that are going to be better for the society.",3.99W17 LATs,80415,"I had the best experience in my life two years ago.

She always was to me when I needed her, even if I did not need her. In conclusion, share with her that experience was amazing.","I think my city can be a better place to live for young people if we following the next steps. First, young people need to learn more about respect and honesty. Sometimes my city can be dangerous. But we never do anything to change that situation. If we learn more about good things and teach to other people how to be a better person that things can help our city. For example: If we are more honestly and respectly we are going to have a better place to live. Everyone can do things to help the others and we are going to live in a good enviroment. Second, our parents have to be more strict with us. I can see in the streets little children alone. Since they are 12 years they can do whatever they want and when they are 18 or less they have a lot of problems. My country and my city have a lot of problems with young people, but if we do not help the kids when the are growing up they are going to be worster than young people now. Finally, young people have to be more intelligent and respect the rules. They must not drink alcohol or drive when they are drinking because it is dangerous for them and to the other people. I think if their parents are careful when they are a little kids, they will have a real childhood, and their life are going to be very different when they are older.For all these reasons I think if we learn different things when we are childhood we can be better people in the future. That things can help young people right now, but the most important thing is help the little kids.  In clonclusion, my city can be better if we following all these things.",3.99W16 Placement,23170,"I have been living with companions on my mission, couple of months ago, then my parents for couple of months too and now i am here in a residence with some roomates.Because it is my first day with them, i cannot consider that i have been living with them, this is just the beginning.

My city is a student's city which mean that we have a 2 big universities and many students coming from other cities, even from other countries. Those student's like to visit and to go out. The first problem is the people living outside. We are having a huge problem with all those people who just like to stay outside, with their dogs, they stay by groups in many places, usually around ATM machins, they beg for money, dring alcohol, fight and speak loud. Rennes is a city full of beautiful places and is restoring every year some areas, but those people just ruin everything, because it scares the population and the visitors, they don't feel safe., the city should get rid of them. As dancers, me and my friends we like, during sumertime, to practice outside or during winter, to practice in the entrance of a mall, when the mall is closed. And so the police officers, treat us just like them, we are not makimg any noise, nothing but dancing, but they make no differences and so they keep us from practicing anywhere but a close room, which is not easy to have.The city should work on finding a way to help them the best they can and not just let them being a part of the view, the environment.I do believe those persons have a huge value, but they are ruining it when they are just staying aroung and scaring the people.With this change in Rennes, it would be such another athmosphere, so many people would not decide to leave for a better place, but they would decide to stay and participate more in the aprovement.

Considering that I live in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, all my life, I'm going to choose an important improvement that needed to be done in that country. The public transportation needs an urgent improvement.In Brazil we actualy have bus and subway, but is totally unsecurity and full of robbers. This need to change! The Brazilian's President need to invest more money on the safe public transportation and hire some cops to prevent robbers.This way, everyone in my city and not only the people of my age would be happier and I can explain at least two main reasons to sustain my point of view.First, the price of fuel is too high... It's very expansive to use private car to go around the city. Maybe this should sound a little wierd for a reader that lives in US, but in Brazil one pay $12,00 per galon...  It's just too expansive. That's why improving the quality of the public transportation would help more people to use the public transportation and, by doing so, save a lot of money.Second, there are many cars on the streets. Everyone can get a loan in the bank and buy a car there, even if one has no money at all. The problem is that the city don't support so many cars. So, right now, the traffic is just horrible. For example, in Sao Paulo city you can spend 4 hours in your car, just waiting for the traffic. This is a total disaster. If the public transportation was safe, I'm sure that many people would use it more and avoid this horrible traffic situation.In resume, improving the public transportation would make the brazilians life much better.",3.99F15 LATs,07073,"Today i live with two friends, they are very fun and enjoy a lot with them, the personality. one is very silly and crazy , but he is very smart too and he will go to BYU Idaho, he want to study IT.

The trash is a serous problem rigth now in the city. Why? because garbage create polution and unsanity place to live. Garbage produce illness, bad imgen in the city and it is very expensive to goverment manipulate and find a correc solution to improve the trash in the city.  Reciclyn could be an excellent way to reduce  this problems.  The nexts pionts are some things that reciclyng could help in the city. First. Reciclyng reduce the amount of garbage in the city. When every day in the city are more than 5 tons of garbage, reciclyng reduce it when separte the trash in parts to be reuses in other areas. For exsmple, All of the metal trash could be reciclyng to be used to producre other metal pieces or products. Also glass is an exellent example of reciclyng because it could be reciclyng for large companies to produce new cups of glasses or containers. Second. When the trash is reciclyng, it preserve natural resources because reduce the use of other natural resources. For example   tree for paper. Some companies adopt this trend and separete their trash to reciclyng and just buy reciclyng paper for their offices.  Thir and last one. Reciclyng reduce cost to the city to trasnport trash to specifc pint outside of the city. Trasnport trash is lage trucks is expensives and paid to comapnies to destroy the garbage is also expensive for the goverment. If this improvement were aplied like a rule for all people in the city, the cost of transportation would be reduced. People would separte the trash in organic and inorganic and be easier for the city pick up and reciclyng it. In conclusion, reciclyng could be a great improvement in Mexico City.  People and goverment should work together to create a better place to live and every part take their responsability.  A lot of natural resources could be saved if we take advantage of reciclyng.  Exist different way to start reciclyng but the first step is separating the trash in different kind of wastes. and reduce it in our own houses.

One of my roomates it's from Japan she is 18 and she is really cute. the other one is from california and she study in UVU and the other one is from Ohaio and she study in BYU and I dont have a lot of time living with them so I think with the time I'm going to know them better and we can be friends. When I move here I search for a hose to live and a friend contact me with a friend that was selling her contract and I talked to her to bought the contract and that is what I live there. I like to be in my hose because I can learn from them like costums and it help me a lot with the language part to always practice my english and to be better every day and to know more vocabulary.","My city is a big city, there's a lot of things you can do there, there's museams, parks , malls and too many things. I like to much my city it's really beautiful but I will like to make changes. First I would like to make my city more cleanier, because in some places there's a lot of garbage and that is not good. In my city there's too much to do so a lot of turist go there so thats the reason we have to clean the streets, because sometimes when it rains the garbages make that the water acumulate in the street and tha cars can't move fast. I am a student so I think that people that are studiyng too would like more libraries, because they are really far from the city and just one in the cente.  Sometimes when you want a book is most easy to buy one that took someone from the library because it's hard to go to one. Also it would improve the kind of students that the university has because in my city there's a lot of universities where you can go and more libraries would be really really good for students. Also I would like to have places where you can go with your friends and  pass a good time because there's a lot of places you can do that  but sometimes that places are not to good and that's bad. Maybe with this changes people of my ages will be more safty because when they go to bad places the trubles start and the accidents so it will reduce all this bad things.So I think that if my city changes in that way, people can changes too and they can go to more often to a library than a mall and they can spend time in good places and not necesary do bad things to get fun. Also if we learn to clean our city and take care of the thing that are there we can take care of other places too and that is so good because we can help others to do it. All the changes are difficult and hard but if we put our effort on what we want to do we can do it. I know that when our porpuse is good  things work out in our way and I know that change a city is hard but we have to do what we can. We have to take advantage of the places where we live and to take care of them because they are our home and we can make it better places.",4F15 LATs,21045,"Living with nice people have many good reasons.

With education people could have namy great things. That would help them having a good live and having a nice family. Such as, better live and get a good job. First of all, education in Thialand  is not fast and good as it should be. For example, we used to be better in the past but now we are so slow and students do not have to be smart to get to university. So, when they done from school, it is hard to find a job. The important thing is people do not have a good skill to ran the job. If, we change the education, the students from now are going to be a good and smart  people. And, students do not have to go out of the country to go to a better school or get a degree out sied of the country. That would help saving with money and save thire live. Morever, we could have others people come to our country to study, They could help with travle and help the country growing up. It is the worth it. Education change many things. It help people in the country growing with knowlage and reduld bad people. Becaues, people have an education they could have job. And, they could help themself and thire family. The country would be nice to live. The education should have done better.Getting a good job help people have a good live. Firstly, if they have a hing education, they would not be afaid to find a job. They could get a job easily. No more killing each other. When they get a good job and good saraly, they would have a nice family. And the most important rhing is they could help others people too. For example, with the money. They could help people with food or paying for school. So, education come become good things.As you can see, having a bertter live and having a good are the worth.

In the capital of my country we have many problems that i know these can get better if people have a better education. Important thisgs as respect, love and wisdon are getting down and it is impresionat, but do not have a good education influence in it. When people have respect to others this can make easier life. For example, if you are working in a company  and you have personal problems you do not have to go to work with a angry face and give attention to people in that way. This can make unhappy the life of other person, and problems can start if there is not respect. Is sad but this ussually happens. Also making with love the things that you have to do make everything better that is because we will do better our job and wherever that we have to do. It is sad when you go to the hospital and doctors or nurses give a bad attention in many cases that happen because they are doing a work that they do not love. We have to love the things that we do and specially all the people. This can make a society and better place to live.Because of we do not have a ggod education there is not wisdom. and this is very important because if yo have to succesful in the life you need to have wisdom. This can change getting a better education and working hard to get all the wisdom and developing the skills that everyone have. I know improving those things can help a lot my city because these are priorities that we need to develop our country and our society.

So, I really think that this activities will help us to improve our concentration in the our jobs, we will be better parents, and we will be more creative.The first one, about improve our concentration is because when we work in a stress enviroment we just want to finish our day and come back to our homes, so we are not doing our best, we are thinking all the time in what we would like to do in that moment. But if we have activities out of our work , we will be able to release our stress and our problems and we will be better in our jobs.Second, we will be better parents as well, is ver usuall that the parents forget about theirselves to care their children, and also for work and all the responsabilities that we have. But, that is very dull, we loved enjoy moment with our children, but sometimes we need our own moments, and to have our own activities will help us to give a better kind of space with children, we will be able to share with them without stress.Finally, one of the most important skills for the world  that we have to be have is being creative. And is too difficult beig creative when we have stress. The last and most importante bussiness succes have came from of the creativity of the people. And also the key to care our world is what we can create to preserve our plannet and our ressources.

Education is one of the most powerful tool for people is 21 years old , because they could have oppportunities to improved their habilities in differents careers  and get good future future jobs . Education is a important tool for the people that are looking for opportunities, knowledge and good future jobs. And education is one of the unique way to get it.  Education is a pawerful tool for people is 21 years old ,because they need opportunities in short and long term. Opportunities in short term would be multiple because when people have education thier focus will be different, they spend time in different activites and hobbies will be different to for example they have been spending time studying than play video game, look for stupid activities. Just they will look for do thier homework, read book and activities to be smart. In conclusion there are the short term opportunitiesfor give education. Opportunities in long term when they recived educacion and finished thier carrers. They will be smarter and they could get better jobs. Because when someone got education and finish his digree someone is ready to be a really good tool for the contry and his vision will be so different ,because he will mix his experieces and knowledge. There are long term for people recive education in my city. In conclusion in my city could has a lot of changes,  but any one like education, because education is a powerful tool  and permit that people is 21 years old get habilities and better jobs.

Sousa is a small city that does not have enought thing for young people like me to do their. However, I thoughts in some points that Sousa could improve that would make the city a better place to live like people in my age,  jobs,  a mall, and parks. Sousa is so small that there are not many jobs for everyone because of that some people are leaving the city to another city to look for a job. However, the most people that is doing that are people between 18 to 40 age because they want to work and study. Moreover, we can find better jobs in others cities. The goverment should proveid more jobs for the adults that is leaving from hight school, the goverment can proveid more grocery store and shops, and hotels for turist. Sousa also need a mall that people can go in and have fun shooping and watch a good movies. Sousa does not have a mall that people can shopping and restaurant in it. There is a little branch that people can buy some clothes. The goverment should build a huge mall with cinema in side the mall, and also creat a lot of place for children play and have good time. Moreover, people between 18 to 45 age like to have good time shooping, eating, and talking with friend.  A mall is a perfect place for people do that. Finally, Sousa should have parks to children and young people and families play and enjoy the time as a family and a beautiful place. In Sousa there are not parks where people can go to have fun times with freinds and family. If the goverment build a beautiful parks where people can play, we would not see many young people in bars and drinking bears and smoking. This is consequence from the city Sousa does not have a lot thing to young people to do.  That city can improve a lot build parks for everyone.  In conclusion, If in Sousa have jobs,  mall and parks, the population could increse in great amount. However, could help people to have more fun moments with families and the young people do not have to leave for another city to look for a job and to be far of their families. Sousa could improve and to be a better place to live for people in my age.

I am from mexico and is a popular contry becuase not is segurity.

Actually, people that were borned after the year 1990 are called millenars. Millenars will be the responsible for the economy in the future and to take the decisions in the future, however many of these millenars share one thing in common: the unnemployment. One imporvemnet that we demand is better education opportunities, more jobs and new governements.Many of these young adults do not have good educational opportunities. Many bright minds are lost in low wage works, other are involved on drugs and others think that they are too poor to dream for a education. Many schools are really expensive or the public schools have a lot of demand that a lot of people do not have the opportunity to get into a school. AS a consequence they find a world in the drugs and the alcohol, they start doing deals that allow them to make money, so they think it is a good life. A reallity is that most of the young people that don't study is because they think that they are too poor to aspire to a education. WE demand more opportunities that include scholarshiops, more places to more students and high quality schools.One improvemnt that all the world needs is more employments. We see people expending money, new enterprises that invest in MExico, however we do not see new jobs or opportunities to improve.

When we hang out, we usually watch the movies, eat some delicious food and go to cafe to drink some sweet beverage. We can find anything we want to do and enjoy in our city. I think my city has many convenient places to enjoy, such as restaurants, theaters, mall, etc. But I think people in my city need more places where people can study for several reasons. First of all, In my city, there are only many places to enjoy spending the time with friends or families but not places to study such as libraries. people can enjoy when they spend the time with their firends or family. However, when they need to study for test or something else, They only can go to libraries.There are some libraries, but they have limited spaces. they can't accept all people who want to study in there. When I go to library, everytime I go there, I had to wait for the seats because there are too many people to accept.  Second, people who should study for many reasons usually go to the cafe. So when I go to cafe with my firend to enjoy, I can see many people who are studying on the table. Of course, all people have a right to do what they want in cafe. However, I can't talk with firend loud and laugh because I'm sorry to them who is studying in there.  Finally, the big city, not my city, has many places to study such as study cafe where people can study silencly.

I would like to propose this two ideas: first, more places to do sports, like more free soccer matches, skateparks, of little gyms in the parks. And second, more activities at college or universities, like free yoga classes, chess championships, or more relax things for young people at these places. Now I'll talk about my first idea: I think my city needs more places to do free sports, because the young people of these days are too lazy, and they don't want to pay a gym; also they spend a lot of time closed in their apartments, playing videogames, just watching TV or looking at their smartphones. So, to have free sports places in the city will help to take their attention on going out of their apartments and make sports; they don't need to pay, so,they will go happy to make sports all the time they want, and their will be bussy doing something productive or healthy. The young people will be healthy with more places like these.And the second point: My city needs more relax activities for young people, because they are too stressed with their studies, their families (or because they are alone in this city), their social lifes and things like that. If they have a relaxed moment in the day, they'll feel too much better; they won't think about the studies, families or social life, they just will think about themself and they will take a time to rest; it have been comprobated that, when you are working and you take a rest of twenty minutes, your brain will work better, because it hasn't all the charge over him. Meanwhile, if you work and work without stop, your brain could colapse and you could forgive the things you was trying to do, or normal things you should do day by day, because you are colapsed. So, a relaxed time every day is good for our healthy and specially for the young people of this city.In conclussion, to have a better place to live in this city, we need healthy people and healthy lifes, and for that we will offer to young people free sport places and relaxed places to have fun and recreate between them.",4.03S17 Placement,18822,"I live with my parents when I was stydying in University.

Or, what's even worse - to get into a bad group of guys which will have a very bad influence. I mean drugs, alcohol and other things like that. Because it's a very big problem in Russia and especcialy in small cities (although my city's population is about 1.5 millions, it still has such problems with young people).I am sure if there would be much more sport grounds and open courts and fields to play sports, young people would spend more time doing sports rather then sticking with a bad company and ruin their health even.Also, Russia is very weak at some sports. For example, we dont have a good soccer time now. If all the kids in Russia would have more support in that, maybe in 5-10 years we would have much more better players to play for our country.If we compare it to USA, and basketball for example, there is a basketball hoop almost by every house and there are outdoor fields ll over the neighborhoods in big cities. That's why USA has the best basketball team in the world.Another problem I think is a job and working places for young specialists who just finished the university.The salary might be so small if you want to work according to your speciality, so lots of students who just finished the university have to find another job to have a bigger salary.Our government should be concerned about that and how they can better provide working places for the young specialists.  We also still have problems with medicine and quality of the hospitals for example but it is another big topic for discussion and it's been better for the last 5-7 years as the government let city to have more private clinics to provide health care to people in the city.Tahir Hasbiullin",4.03W16 Placement,33295,"I was living with my sister an her husband.

Bogota is a ten million inhabitants city, about the 60% are youngs and children, and less than the 20% of the youngs can acced to a high education institution. Bogota needs more middle and high education institutions and a good way to finance it. In that way people wold be better prepared and the life quality will grow.First of all there are only 5 universities placed on the top 50 of Best Latin American Universities, considering that almost all universities of Colombia are in Bogota, is an bad sign. The existent universities can't accept all people from Bogota becauce people from thje rest of the country are applying to study, I would say that almos the 50% of the students are non-bogotans. Almost each university could accept about 2000 students per semester and that is not enough. considering that thera are reduced places to each career. If the Gouvermet invest in new public universities the student spots would be lighter. Bogota is a city were the inequality is noticeable, the scolarship are almos null and almost the 70% of the population earns low salaries. this point is almost the most important because only the richest people can afford the high education and also only those who could afford a good college cand be accepten in the goog universities. Public middle education stitution are bed. So it is difficult to get a credit if you have a bed credit also. so sometimes is imposible to study.In conclusion, Bogota faces a big and hard problem. Making more universities ang may it easy to pay woul be a great idea to allow all Bogota youngs to study.

Cheonan is a small city in South Korea as well, so sometimes people do not know about that. However, I know that because I have lived in Cheonan for 15 years, and it is my father's hometown as well. As I say, it is a small town, so it has grown up fast since 2005. In contrast, it needs to make several improvements recently for people. Especially, there is an improvement which Cheonan needs to make is in terms of all services of bus, it would benefit in order to save money and make people happier than before.First, if Cheonan changed all service of bus, people in my age could save money because a lot of people in my age usually use the bus to go somewhere. Bus fees in Cheonan is the most expensive in South Korea. There is several reasons why it is so expensive. First, some people in the bus company stole all bus fees for 3 years. In addition, the police did not get caught them, so they did not pay about money which they stole. Also, people do not use the bus than other cities because my city is smaller than other city. In my opinion, Cheonan can decrease the bus lines which people do not use a lot. And then, my city decreases the bus fees for people in my age. That is why I think they could save money if they made this improvement.Secondly, the bus in Cheonan is so popular because the service is so terrible. Usually, people and bus drivers fight, and bus drivers are so rude to people. Almost all of people do not want to use the bus in their city, but there is just bus to go to other place except their own cars.

The service of public transportation have to do something to provide i better service or at least to improve the buses that they are using to provide the actual service, it would be great to travell in one of those units during the spring having a cool cliamte in side the bus or having a warn climate during the winter, users would be happier and they would not have to be worry about to get sick.",4.05W17 LATs,11171,"Since I moved here to United States, I have been living with amazin people.

Many reasearches show that  people's needs increase the crime in any city. What I mean with this, is that when people need something they just have to survive and the decide to steal ar find any way to get easy money, that usually all of those ways are usually ilegals. However,  with professional people, this problem will decrease a lot, people should not have the need to steal or do any illegal thing to get money because they can study and, find a good job. Second, in my city or in my whole coutry we depend a lot of other countries, and the reason why, is because we are no prepare enough to work with our own resources. However, having a government paying the high education this problem will decrease, and instead of need a lot of help from different countries, we can use our resources from our people.Third, as we know already, the future of any country or city is their children. If the goverment pay for high education for people of my age, every one will study and their children will race with the same thoughts, there will no have any excuse and they will keep this in mind by seeing their families example.Therefore,if government pay for high education for people of my age in my city, the crime and poverty will decrease,",4.05W17 LATs,76843,"I lived withe my odersisiter in Lehi city. she is own retereant and, she was liltle high and kind, she has a black hair and balck eyes like me and she likes to cooking tranditon foods for us.

However, they do not know how to obtain the success, and they do everything without taking care about  how their steps can affect to others. In adittion, with humble pople, we can get responsible people, hard workers, and good thinkers people.Responsiblity comes from people with values, being humble, is a value applied. Humble people want the well being of everybody, and more of their family, so they implement the responsiblity on their lives and their home. For example, in a family the man works, and the woman has to take care about the children, a man that is not humble, can waste the money he earns on games, or beer, but a humble man, knows that it money can be useful to buy food, clothing, or medicine. Those kind of thinking is that reponsibility makes to think in a person. To be responsible in your life, help you plan your priorities and get your goals. Humble people are hard workers because they already know the need of being autosufficients. In a world without hard workers we could not have anything we already have, because someone has to made it, and someone had to work hard and think hard to make it, why and to who. This quality can help because everyone can apply it, and we will be a city without lazzyness, especially on milenials people, because we are the furutre of the world, and we do not want people without goals and ideas to improve. Hard workers will always being welcome on each work field.  Good thinkers people have humility on their hearts and help other to find the peace on their lives. Good thinkers are people who have thought about their lives and have planned many steps to follow for a good life style. They give you another point of view of things and teach you how to do something intead affecting to others. Nevertheless the age, there are many  good thinker people, and this could be a good source at the time to improve. We could work as a team and get our goals. In conclusion, I think if Guayaquil city had many humble people, can develop, and were a city with good values, and you know that values make you be good person. Finally if we combined every quality describes before, we could have a real improve in Guayaquil city.",4.05F15 LATs,46994,"I have lived with a few people during the course of my life, but the most time I have spent with someone was the time I was living at home.

After they left I started spending a great amount of time with my mom, she likes to cook and watch movies.

The three things my city should change or add is a Mall, more parks and it should change and renew the streets.First, my city does not have a mall. Many people likes to spend their weekends on a mall because you can find everything there, you can eat delicious food, you can shop and you can play. I believe that people my age would benefit greatly by having a mall, they would be able to spend more time with their friends doing activities together instead of just going out and just talk.Second, another thing that my city should change is the number of parks. My city is not a big city, it has many mountains and many of the people  that lives there loves to exercise outside and they adore the nature, especially people my age, they often go camping or hiking. More parks are necessary because young people needs more motivation to go out and enjoy the nature. Also, parks would help people to respect the nature more and be more clean.Third, the streets on my city has some problems. You can notice it while you are driving, it is not dangerous but it is not comfortable either. People my age knows how to drive and they move around the city in their parents car most of the time. Renewing the streets would be a positive change because that would mean less accidents for young inexperienced new drivers.Clearly, my city has many great things but there is always room for improvement.

Even though there was a difficult time during terrorism, now the number of deliquents in Peru is increasng. Unfortunatedly, the Peruvian government is not changing the laws to eradicate the violence in diverse aspects. Therefore, Peru would be a perfect place to live if the Peruvian government changes the laws. The population of a country elect governors to live in a peaceful place. Peruvians want the same. However, the recent governors prefer to receive bribes from the deliquents, instead of changing the laws. The fullfilment of the law is ruled by the government. Therefore, according to the circumstances of a country, the governors could modify the law so that its citizens live in peace and foreign people visit and delight of its wonders. On the other hand, if the Peruvian government change its laws to punish the deliquents, the youth in Peru would change its perspective of life. Being that, the scenario of violence  is an inadequate environment to grow up. For example, many children and teenagers in Peru think that the laws in a country are optional. It is sad that every generation is losing the true concept of what are laws and how they can protect us. People around the world need to know that the desobedience of a law has a punishment. In conclusion,  Peru can be a better place to live if the Peruvian government stops of receiving bribes of deliquents, changes its laws, and promotes the obedience of its laws. In that manner the childhood and youth could be benefited in having a significant concept of law and obedience.

I live in Provo for seven months ago, and Ilke to live here. However, it needs some improvements such as other cities. Provo is a city of students where many of them do not have a car. An improvement I would do is the public transport in Provo. it would be available  more regularily and weekend. It also would be cheaper than  now, and it would have more stop around the city. I know people of my age it is agree with it. Many students would benefit with this chage because they would need a car, move to the city esily, to use it any time.It is very difficult to move around the city. I f you do not have a car you can do nothing. For this reason, students work and save money to buy a car. Students need money for books, copies, food, apartment, etc. To have a car is other spend that they can save if the public transport would be cheaper and better than now. If students would not the need to buy a car they could spend the money in other thing more important than a car.To move around is diffcult many places is far one of other. For Intance, I do not have a car and I need to walk 20 minutes to go to the supermarket, or 30 minutes to go to the University. I spend a lot of time walking. Some people have bike it is a good option. However, in Winter where snow many times it is almost impossible to ride bike. If the public tranport would have more stops on different places- specially important places- and more frecuently the live of the student would be easy.Students move many times during the day such as the University, the library, supermarket, etc. If public transport would be available for a long of time it would be great! Students need facilities to study and work. They have few time to spend in walking or few money to buy a car. It helps to students a lot of.In conclusion,  Improvements are to do better people's life. If I could do some improvement in Provo it would be about the public transport because it is bad specially for the students.

If they choose to stay honest and true to  basic principles we can change the city, and the country. And they need even more honest citizens to help them keep the security and the well being of the city. I honestly don't know what would be the actual impact of this, I just know it would be for the good of all of us.",4.05W17 LATs,66486,"Living with other people is a little difficult if you are not a tolerate person. I live with five girls here in United States. Two of them are mexicans but are very different. One of them is married and the otherhas a boyfriend. One of them is short and thin, the other is tall and fat. They have a lof of problems because they think in different way. Another girl is from Chicago, she is amazing because she is so kind with every one. She is beutiful and she has a lot of dates. Her roommate is from Utah, she is a good person. She sings perfect and also she is learning to dance. She studies in BYU than all of us. They always are happy and they talk to me a lot. However, my roommate is from Mississippi. She is thin but she uses a lot of make up. She is sometimes funny, but we had a lot of problems because of her boyfriend. I like living with them because they usually care about me. They always ask me if I need something. I think they are amazing. They always want to go out with me. They want to teach me about anything. But they do not wash the dishes and that is disgusting. I love those girls even when they are so different, because I learn more about how to live with other people.","We have a lot of problems in my city that make our city bad. We have problems like traffic, environment, and crime. One of the most important is the last one because any of us are safe. We have a lot of problems because of the security. If we have better police we can improve this. We have at least 20 crimes per year and almost all of them are for young people. We should have more people to take care about our city. If we have more police on the streets and less thiefs we will be safe.First, young people usually want to go out even if there is any person that will kill you. In Bogota you can be kill just for your phone and that is a big problems. Thiefs know that young people usually have a good phone, for that reason they always go for them. If you do not give your phone they kill you but sometimes if you do they also kill you. Young people always want to use their phones and for that reason they are in dangerous. For instance, one my older brother was using his phone and a guy go into the bus and said 'give me your phone now or I will kill you', he had because any person do anything. Even if the police see that he/she will not do anything. Young people usually is kill because of their phones. Second, young people always want to go to any party. However, in clubs or in any party you are always in dangerous. Parents say that is better if their children are in house drinking, but there is a lot of problems with that. If you are in a big party police can go to your house and they start fight with all the people that is in the party. If you are in a big party you can have a lot of problems with your friends because of the alcohol or another things. In the other side, if you are in a club you can have problems because sometimes because go inside and attack all the people. Usually police take people that are in clubs I they hite them. Furthermore, when you will leave the club is a problems there are a lot of people on the streets and some of them are thiefs. There is a big problem when you are young and go out at nights. In summary, if we have more police on the streets and less thiefs we will be safe. First, because we can be kill because our phones and that is not fair. Second, because if it is your birthday and you want to go to a party or a club, you are in dangerous. Our city have a big problem with the security but our government do not do anything for improve that. If we continue like that many people will kill but without a reason. We should have a better city because is our city where we live.",4.06W17 LATs,57157,"I had the opotunity to serve a mission and be there was a little hard because for first time I had a companion for twenty four hours , whole the week that was so hard.

However, despite of the differences my companion and I shared a good moments and unforgotten. She is a happy person with possitive mind, those things help me to develop my skills to talk or searching people. With the days we knew better, each other told the experiences about our lives and how this experiences can help us to help to the investigators. I love live with people who has goals and do everything to achievent. Have a roomate or a companion is a challenge but they have a good attibutes too. I never should change that experience in the mission because I could undestand more about my passion that it is all about life, human behavior, and culture.","Peru is a wonderful country, with many opportunities as other country. Barack Obama said: ' No is necessary to leave from your country to find a good opportunities, if you are good you can do all the thing wherever you are'. That's truth!

Finally, change the poor mind of this generation and give them motication throuhg example and show them that it is possible. Starting for the politic in my country, this need change because people who is already rich is more rich with and the poor people continue being poor pople. The reason for this is because in the government exist bad economic distribution. If that change it could be a benefict for people of my age. With a good distribution people can have more opportunities from the goverment. The goverment can infer more programs of capacitation according the carrer of the person, or develop a employ sistem, and have a conextion with international universities and give to people a scholarship. Those ideas would be wonderful because people can go for their dreams and would exist a balance in the society.We live in a society who always said it is hard or why dont take other way. In my persanal life that was the situation. People around me said that we only need married and have a family and then dedicate only to your family.  Other people said that you should be ok with the thing that you have right now. I tell you some this words because this short words have a impact in the mind of the chindren, teenengers or adults. I consider that if there are different programs about superation this poor ideas that people advice us would desappear. People like me if recive this kind of training would have another mentality and they will go far away following their goals and achieve. The succed depending of your perspective, your power mind and  the motivation personal and yourself. We grew up in different circuntances, different family culture and sometimes we still live in a buble. However if the politic change and people can find help to increase their habilities or skills that would be a possitive effect in my society. This generation would be better that the past.

Young people can achieve different thing if f we help us.        First, improve our area of sport.  Almost young people like to do sport, and my city is difficult to find areas of sports. Additionally, if there are areas of sports, you need to pay to use it.  If the goverment spend money to improve this, the result would be that young people dedicate to do sport. One of the inmediate consenquences would be that youn people don't use drogs. Because they could be just focus in the sports.One of long-term consequences  would be that the security in our city increase.  Young people that try to improve their health,           Second, improve our education in the college. My city has several problems with the education. For example, young people try to get excellent jobs, but they don't have the knowlegde that the companies requiered. We need to spend money and time with improve our education. The inmediate consequences would be that students will be prepare to get any jobs. Because they will have the knowlegde to do everything in their future jobs. The long-term woul be that we will have more professionals with excellente preparation. Moreover, young professional improve our enviroment like schools, jobs, streets, etc.          In conclusion, the best way to improve our city are give better areas of sport our young people and spend time to improve their education in the colleges.",4.06W17 LATs,28964,"The people who  I was leaving after to come here were my family, my mother, my father, and my 3 sibings.

In colombia we have many malls. Just in Bogota we have almost 21 malls around the city where people spend money and time looking always the same. It is a tradition of a colombian family, that sunday is normally to be in the mall. It is not funny that everysingle sunday expend time doing the same. It is important that the goverment decrease the number of mall construction and they start to build more parks. it helps the young people to be closer to their families, to relax reading or doing another activity that increase the stresful of daily activities, finally helping the environment.The family is the most important in our lives. Today,  the people prefer spend time in front of a TV than with their families, they don't know anything about each other. it is why the only day that they have the should be talking and spending time as a family. If the goverment created a park specially for picnics, bbq or activities with a lot of security. it will increase the number of happy families.  For example, I remember when I was a child my mother travel with me for 1 hour every sunday to sausality a little town in Colombia just to be with me playing with a ball or reading out loud. I loved those plans with my mom because today I can say that I love to be with my mother. The people need love and feel support by their family if their spend a really value time with them the society will gor up with more unity. Spending time doing relaxing activities is important for young people. Our daily live is so stressful and when the weekend coming we prefer spend time in parties or crowders places. my generation doesn't have time to relax or to be alone thinking about the future or the good alternative for their live. they should spend more time in outdoors activities learning about the world or just being alone with theirselves. When I feel stressful I need to walk without music and people just me and my mind thinking the best way to control and achieve all my tasks. Particulary in Bogota we don't have many places to seat and just think or do homework because we just have one library but this is so far away so if they change one mall for one relaxing space they are helping to the society to grow up relaxing.Finally,  the environment is important today. We are causing many damage to the environment creating more construction,  using more chemicals and products that generate pollution and create a visual contamination it is not good for our life or for the future generations. we need a city of peace and for sure we need this planet. the goverment should regulated better the construction because we are in a society that just think about money and consume. it is kill our planet and it is kill ourselves. for example, in just the construction of titan plaza ,one of the most important malls in Bogota they used 632 trees to created the lobby because it is builded with wood because it looks fancy for the consumers. it is not fair for the environment that just for our idea of rich or statues with use innecesary our natural resources. In short, many cities need more spaces to spend with family, relaxing and that helps with the environment. if the goverment has a lot of money to build more the will ahve money to create more parks that are helpful for human beings.",4.06W17 LATs,30352,"This semester  I live with  a wonderful person.

This is a  huge problem because affect in different ways the students. The schools should  incorporate a program that permit students  to work in their schools because they could work in the same place that they study  saving time, and also they can be more independent. Student could work in their schools because this is a good option to save time.  In Santiago, students that work and study at the same time are very sacrified because they do not have time to share with their family or friend;therefore, they do noy have a social life. For example,  The person, who works and studies,  begins  his or her schedule ate  8 AM and finishes at 10.  In addition, this students prefer get married when they finish their studies because  they do not have time to date or spend time with their  couple.  With this change, this problem would change helping this people to  have a social life with less sacrifice.  The result would be  possitive.The other benefit is that students would be more independent. This means that the can spend  money in  their own stuff, such as books, clothe, shoes, fun activities, transportation, etc.  Nowadays, students need the support of their parents because  without  them, students cannot  pay the necesary things. Also, this change  affect in a pocitive way students because they can feel better if they are independent, and their minds would less worried. Therefore, this improvement would students feel better.In conclusion, saving time and being more independent are two thigs  very helpful for students if  they can study and work in their  schools.

To be specific, I think city have not good facilities libraries. When I was middle school student, I visit Busan which is near my city, that city library facillity was very nice. They have new computers and a lot of books. However, my city library computers are not very good. Also they do not have many books. In these reasons, I want to change my library facility. Also, every students agree my oppinion too.Second of all, my city have not nice cultural environments. For example, movie theator, departmantstore, concert hall and so on. My city have only big marcket. Therefore, when I want to watch movie, I go to another city. It was very bad. This is because I spend much money buy the train ticket, bus ticket. Also, when I want to go to concert hall, I drive my car at two hours. It was really hard to me. Therefore, my city need built a lot of culture enviroment.Finally, my city have not good hospital system. Thus, many people hurt, and they want to go to hospital. My city have only three hospital. And the hospitals are very expancive. In my experience, when I was high school student, I had hard time studying. This is attributable to the fact I was very sick. However, my city hospital was really expancive.  And far away from my house. If my city have a lot of hospital, lots of people go to clinic center very well.

My suggestions are to build a lot of shopping centers, make more transpotations, and to build a lot of housings     First, we do not have any shopping center in my city, so we need to build some shopping center. All genelation such as young or sinior people like to shopping. However, if there is no shopping center, they cannot go shopping. In my experince, when I go shopping, I need to go next city. I do not like it because I take too long time. If there are shopping centers in my city, we can save their time and really convinient. For this reason, we need to build some shopping centers.      Second, we do not have a lot of transpotaions. Actually, we have buses and trains, but those are not useful. To talk about buses, timetable says bus comes once every 2 or 3 hours. It is not convinient. In big city there are a lot of transpotations and they come many times every hours. If transpotations are set a lots in my city, it will be really useful and efficiently. Thus, we need to make more transpotations such as big cities.      Finally, we have a lot of greens such as trees. A lot of greens are really good to me and to us, but in my opinion, it is too much. I think my city is small becasue people cannot stay my city. There are a lot of place to make housings. If people come to my city and stay, my city will be big city, and my city will be better place to live for all people. For those reasons, we need to build a lot of housings.     In conclusion, building shopping centers, bousings, and making traspotations make my city better place to live.

In this city, we do not have a good life quality, but I believe that things can be changed in that environment principatly for the young people. Nowaday, we do not have a good universities, this is one point very important. One other point would be to build some courts for people to play soccer or voleyball, and also to close some bars by the schools and universities. I think that doind theses things, my city would be better.         First, I know that many young students do not like to study, but I know that good universities help to improve our lives a lot. Today I live in U.S. just because I do not have a good university in my city. A good university in my city would be excellent for people that want to gave a good education in their lives.           Second, people need have fun in their lives. So, in my city we need to build more courts because we can play soccer and other sports. My city eventhough to be very small, it has a lot of cars, and everyone know that cities with many cars cause traffic, and traffic cause stress, so for that reason, if we construct more courts, we can relax playing our favorite sport and have a lot of fun with our family and friends.          Finally, by universities and schools, we have many bars. In my opinion, I would help my city to improve closing theses places. For example, in Sao Paulo many bars and pubs closed the doors because students from universities and schools did not concetrate at the study. Bars and pubs are very very alowed in Brasil principaly in my city. Now, in Sao Paulo, theses bars are very far way of tha schools and universities.

If there is a problem that Lima always have had, is the vehicules hard traffic. For this reason I believe that one improvement that will made my city a better place to live for people of my age is to improve the vehicule traffic sistem. One way this problem can be fixed is by the implementation of bikeways all around the city. Bike ways will motivate the young people to use them and by using them there will be less vehicules traffic, less contamination and young people will be healthier.Bike ways will motivate young people to use them. By using bikes instead of their own cars , young people are going to help the city  because the streets will be less crowed with cars. This way the city will look more clean and in order.

This means that there will be a lot less contamination of the air. We know that vehicules contaminates a  in big amounts the air.

In many ocations the people of all ages get mad because of the public transportation. The bus dirvers sometimes are rude to the people and they doesnt stop in the bus stop. One thing thay may change this problem would be the new form of public transportation. Make the city look more preatty and confortable to use public transportation. One of the changes that would hep to this problem will be set up a new train transportaion sistem.                    In may cities arround the globe have trains for public transportation. It is faster and fancyer to use trains. It would make my city looks like those cities, like New York of San Francisco. Is very often that people there, even adults or young people use the trains to go to work or have fun with freinds. That improvement in my city will make a difference. The people in my city used the public transportation as the only way that some pople have to go to work or  with firends.                    The public transportation is awfull sometimes, its going faster or slower it just depends on the driver condition. For example, if the bus dirver is happy even if he is late he will stop for all the people and act kind for others, but, if he is angry he wont be a nice dirver and if he is late he wont stop for other people. For instance, the city needs a new and revolutionary public transportation.                   For the young adults, the new train sistem will make the life more fast and easyer. For exampe, the trains arrive every 10 minutes and they go to a certian speed, even if the train diver is happy or unhappy that wont change anything. It would be faster to go to school or to have fun with the frends. Many people will benefit with this new train transportaion sistem.                  In conclusion, to make a city a better place to live some thing have to change.

When I came to Provo for the first time it was frustarting to find a good house to live. most of the houses are really old or in an old neighborhoods. My husband and I spend more than a month to find a place and finally we had to choose off campus housing apartments. The other day we were talking about how is neccesery for the government t have a plan to renew or build a new and modern complex in the city, Specially when a large group of students move to Provo every year. They are young and they love to live in new places. It's gonna affect their personal life a lot. It may make most of them to stay after they graduation. I guess this is one of the lon-term consequences of this project. If I want to talk about immediate result of renewing houses or building new ones, I can talk aout the view ofthe city which is a big concern of most governments.I can see very good process in this issue in Orem. There is tons of new complex and apartments. Most of my husban's friends are moving to Orem. We also found a nice apartments in Univerdsity Place in Orem and we are moving there in May. As you know Provo is the happiest city in the U.S and after you ove here you dont wan't to leave. If we had more options we would stay in Provo.",4.09W16 Placement,68384,"The best roommates that I had were my parents. I lived with them for all my life and I enjoyed that time.My father's name is Daniel, he is not very tall and he works for the church, he is 58 years old. What I love abut him are the long talks we had after lunch and before going to bed. Also he used to be the best person to watch a movie with, but as the time went by his taste on movies wasn't as good as before, so I had to choose the movies. My mother's name is Carminia, she is 56 years old and she is the most beautiful woman in the world.  She is a very given person, ready to help the people in need and ofcourse the best cook. What I learned from her is her dedication and all the efford she puts into her church callings.I used to play jokes at her and every morning my father liked to put his music on very loud while he would work out.So, this is the first time I'll be away from them and I'll have a new roomate. I know it's going to be an experience with its pros and cons, but I'm looking forward to this new stage of my life.","Something that my city is in need of are more places to have outdoor activities with friends and peers. This is because the only places you have are movie theaters and malls and when you want to do something different you run out of options.Once I went to a place were you could climb up diferent walls and I thought that it was a very nice activity because it was very fun and a good way to excercise, I thought that it was so much better than just seat and watch a movie with your popcorn and your soda. It also motivates comunication, it gives you the place to talk and make new friends. I felt really bad when I went back and I realized that they had to close because they ran out of bussiness. People didn't buy that idea. If I also would like to mention another thing that is necesary in my country for people my age. That is better scholarships for making a Masters degree or  any other tipe of specility. Eventhough we do have universities that provide this studies, they are  too expensive or just not good enough if you want to have the proper education to improve your job oportunities for  a better income. I think this is the reason why people my age pospone their marriage decision for to long and the concept of family is deteriorating among people who are not members of the church. But as the time goes by it is sad to see that members of the church also start to think as they do and they pospone their marriage untill they finish their studies and since they are very expensive they have to wait for too long.In Bolivia there are many things that need to be emproved in order to have a better life style for people my age, but I have to admit that the present goverment is staring to see how importat education is and how necesary it is for the development of the citizens and therefore for the country. Recently they had lunched a new tipe of scholarship for students that wanto to study aborad on the the best schools, but the problem is that it's managed by the people of the goverment's party and  the corrution level among them is very high so it makes it very difficult to apply for this scholarships and be elected.Education is the best investment that any goverment could make to improve a country's reality and that is what we need to improve in my country and I belive it is a very common issue all over the world.",4.09F15 LATs,19122,"I'm living with my wife at Wymount Terrace.

Remotely jobs helps people to save time and save money. Studies show that more than 80% of people spend more than one hour every day on comute to their jobs. Many people who graduated from college are looking for jobs. If these new proffesionals have the opportunity to work remotely they will save time in their comute to work. Imagine this, one hour in the rush hour every day are 5 or 6 hours at week. Six hours in your car driving are 24 hours at month. In other words, people who spend an hour in their comute to work could save one day at month to do wathever they want. Also, people who spend more than 30 minutes in their car have higher levels of stress. This stress is not helpful for employees to achieve their tasks.There is not many jobs for every single graduated student. This is because there are not enough companies willing to pay for more employees. If work remotely is adopted in those companies, they will be able to hire more people. Consequently, more graduated students will have a job. This is because companies will not need to spend a lot of money in big facilities. If companies decided to move their operational facilities to smaller buildings they can hire people who is willing to work remotely and save the space in their building for other operational functions. Young adults want to have more time with their friends and families. This times are the best to live and nobody wants to spend their time in their cars. One hour of driving could be one hour of work out or hangout with friend if work remotely is adopted in this city.

Is a exelent place for spend time in cultural activities and social activities. the problem is that is no safety walking arroud the historic ceer during day and is a suicie if you want to take a walk during the night , that is because each citizen needs to have a courage and demand more security from the goberment .

In my age they are a lot of students searching for a good school and a nice job to starts they live. But in  In the city that i came from are jobs and  school education.       There are a lot of people ho are searching for job but they cant not find it. One of the reason is that the age of the people  are going to retired  is high and the people ho will get his place job are o lot. This is one of the reason that the goverment needs to work on. The students that finished the school and have they degree can't find whey job. Another critic problem is that there are not place to work. It means that the citizens that want job is more higher that the company or industry that gives jobs. My country need to open a new place or do something for hiring all this people that wants the a job.      The other improvement that my city need are the school in generarly. General i meant  school standart, leassons, books teachers with experience and oportunity to take a good degree. It will be a good to work in school. In this school it is a non function way to do lesson that a student can learn better and more. Maybe bacause my city came from a bad regime that still have that mentality in all the incitutions. The school bilding still are those of the end of the second WW2. They need to replace them.       These basic think that my city need to improve . This are essential. Every country need to have it.

However, Sao Paulo could be a better city if the government had the desire to invest more in education and entertainment.First, education is a key for those who want to be succeessful, so the goverment should spend more money investing in education because this can create a better envirement for youth. Young people usually are looking for opportunities to gain good education and way to acheive their dreams. Consequently, If my city had a manner to change the actual situation, It would change the people's vision about Sao Paulo. The effects would be immediate because more people will have the desire to continue living in my city. In conclusion, the goverment should find a way to invest more in education becuase this will help to keep young people having the desire to live in Sao Paulo.Another manner to improve the style of the young people who live in Sao Paulo is to invest more in entertainment. Young people love to have opportunities to stay with their friends, and to have fun. Consequently, It is a wise idea to invest more in enterteniment such as shoppings, parks, party places, and others places like that. Young people are very excited, and they like to know new things, because of that, it is important to create more places where young people can spend time with friends. Concluding, investing in enterteniment is a good way to improve the life of those who have the same age that I have.In conclusion, Sao Paulo is a great city where people can be happy; however, there are several things that Sao Paulo can improve to create a better style of life for those who pertence to younf people. The best two ways to create a better city are to invest more in education and enterteniment because those things will benefit young people in a short and long-term.

Now, I really love my place of birth but there are some things that need to be fixed in order to people from my own age to feel more safe and secure. Things that I would suggest to be changed. Many citites in the Unite States have shown a major change just because a little change was made. With this idea in mind, Lima can have a great change in terms of delincuency that is directly connected with education and work.The biggest improvement I would suggest is related to work along with education. Being the largest and more populated city in the whole country, with more than nine million people, Lima has a lack of opportunity, specially in terms of work. This may be the reason why so much delincuency has been seen in the past decade. In 2009, this city was ranked by the Federation of Delicuency as the second place with greater rate of youth delincuency in South America. The implement of more jobs will definelitly make a major change in the country. For instance, college students usually are in charge of their own payment education, and with this , they seen themselves inmerse in many illegal trades in order to get benefits from the colleges or from work.By increasing the opportunities of work for college students, the rate of delicuency will surely come down, and the enviroment will feel more safe.

In this document I will address one important topic and the points of view regarding to it, and that is how the safety plays an important role in the young people's life and how if we improve this we can create a brighter future for the next generations.One of the mayor problems is that El Salvador (in general) has a lot of violence. Talking more about the capital, lately we are getting to a point when the people don't want to get out of the houses because they are affraid that something bad is going to happen to them in a bus, the street, in your job, school, etc. This affects a lot to the young people because they are living in a city that is controlled by fear and not love. If we improve the security of the city, for example having more cops or decreasing the corruption we will have a better society, but a higher level will be teaching the importance of sharing and loving all men. If we teach this principles in our homes, the violence will decrease. In a short term this would improve the relationship between fathers and sons, we will have a society that cares more about the importance of family and strive to keep it united, it would increase the employment, and the quality of life by itself would rise. In a long term the economy of our city will be way better, we could reduce the poverty in the city, help the new generations by having a better enviroment. People will like to invest in our city.  The decision to change is ours. We can decide to create that future for our generation, and most important is that we are lying the fundations for the next generation, the future that we build will be founded in the history that we do today. We can create that future if we strive to live in armony with our fellowman.",4.12F15 LATs,13935,"I moved to united stated 7 months ago.

Furthermore, the bathroom was really dirty, I hate when they left the soap or hair in the shower. it was disgusted. More over, they had a lot meeting during the week.

I think that was an amazing change in my cities for many reasons. First of all, before you could take just 30 minutes to arrive to your work or school but 4 years ago you have to get out of your house 1 hours before to arrive early. but this change not helpful to other people that have to short travel because theprice is the same if you want to use this transpotation.                   Another reason, you can be protect because this transportation have an especial station and there are many camera and polices walk around the station so you can't suffer any rob or kidnapping. I think that this project is really good to feel more confident to take a bus. Addition information is that goverment try to implements more buses to enought to all people in Peru, because sometimes in point time there are many congestion and crowded, everybody try to take the bus but could be dangerous to take it. On the other hand, I think that the goverment should improvements and implements more buses because many people give a lot of money for this project so we need to improve just imporve.                    More over, this project could be a good way to teach all the population to be more organized and teach from early to use the transportation and pay for this price because sometimes they think that it could be expensive. but this is up to them to improve the cities and make more updoled/ modern because this project use every countries and when we have to receive or introduce  to the foreigners they could be impress about our advance in our cities.                     In my opinion that one cities or country could see better if we propose many changes and we improve our neighbors.

One of the improvement that I think it will make my city a better place for people of my age is more places for entertainment. Those places that we have right now are a few comparable to other cities in Chile. Most of the people of my city don't know what to do on their dead time and prefer to stay at home which is very bad for them because it increases the sedentarism in our city. Also the weather is very hard to handle with, someday it rains and after the sun shines and then rains again. This places will increase the recreation and activity for this young people and will help them to have an active life. The violance in our city it's because of this people who don't know what to do with their lives and do not do anything after school or University. For example an 16 years old person arrives to his house after all the things that he had to do and learn in school and what do you think that they will prefer, play videogames at home or hang out with his friends even with the knowledge that there are not many things to do outside? He will prefer to stay at home and play videogames.

One of the thigs that I used to though was: Why onle the big people could slice those plastic things. My dad also told me that: 'Those plastic things are credit cards, and you have to be really careful with them'. He had like 5 credit cards. Almost a big part of the people has at least one credit card. They use it when they dont have available money. A credit card is a really big responsability. Only responsable people should have a credit card. I thing that the young people in every countrie shouldn't be allow to have a credit card. One reason why only the big responsable people can have one is becuse they will know when they had to use it. Most of the people want  a credit card but they don't know all the responsabilities that it have. When you have a credit card you can use it all the times that you want, but every card has a limit. When you are on the limit of it you can't us it more. Also, you have to pay for the money that you use. If you didn't pay the money that you have been using; you are going to have interest.  Nobody likes interest because it always makes that you have to pay more that the money that you used before. People with a credit card only should use it when they realy need it, and use it in a responsable  way.Another reason is when you have a credit card you always want to use it. That is a big deal. Is a new thing for young people so they are really excited for that. The bad thing is that if you use it always later you are not going to have enough money to pay for it. You should use only the card when you need it. That is the main thing of a credit card. Even though is a new thing for the person that requires it, you don't have to use it always. Use the credit card only to buy something important, and only if you don't have more money for it. If you recently adquire one of those crazy cards tu have to be really careful with it. In conclussion, have a credit card is a real responsabilty. You have to be always carefull with that. If you doesn't measure the use of the card it can bring you some problems in the future. Young people, most of the times don't think in the future consecuences that something can bring. In addition, some of the best ways to use a credit card are only use it when you really need it. For example: at school to pay a tuiton, or to buy some food. Or things that you really need it and are basic things for your life. If you have a credit card or you are gong to adquire one you have to be really careful with it.",4.16F15 LATs,89007,"I live with my brother and his wife in Pleasant Grove.

If a city have  good tools it will give many good opportunities to future generations. Future generations will be benefit with good quality of life and education. One improvement that would make my city a better place to live for people my age is security because it could have a possitive effect in student's and young people's life and work's opportunities. Improving the security of my city will affect positivily the life of student. The first reason is because of the transportation system. Many student have to travel from their home to college for at least half an hour, and many of them carry laptops and important materials for their class. They have to be worry about the security of the bus because most of them ocurre in there. For example for me was normal to see every day how robber stold the backpack of student when there were distracted. Other reason is the security in streets. As I, many student leaved college at nigth, and it is so dangerous. A lot of people of my age have been abducted at nigth after a party or college. For these reasons, improving the security of my city would help to the life of students and young people.Another important aspect is works's opportunities. People in my city have to look for a job in the financial or center part of my city. It means time and risk because they have to leave early in the morning and back late at night. Sometimes it could be difficult for women to look for a job that not represent a risk. Young people want to feel secure going working, and lack of security limited us for looking for better options that represent a risk for our lifes, and we want the same for our future families. For these reasons, work's opportunities in my city is directly affected by security.There are many improvement that will benefit people my age and security is the principal because it could have inmediate and long-term consequences in our life. Improving the security may help student young workers to be safe and and to not be limited for job's adquisition. Also in the future it would have a possitive effect in the economy of my city and more people will have more opportunities to work and study. Security is an important aspect that would develop the economy and education not only in my city, it is in all the world.",4.16F15 LATs,03098,"One of the person who is very close to me is my classmate. At first we feel like just classmate and no more. Due to our culture are so different, it was hard to have interesting conversation in the begging. After we met at the gym, he started to invite me to go working out with him. That is how everything started.Our relationship became closer and closer as a result of the time we spend at the gym. I knew him better after everytime we talked to each other. For me, he is a person who is easy to understand. Time went by, there is hardly a secret between us. I am glad that we have tried to talk and understand to each other. If we did not make the effort, our relationship would just like other classmates.","Train is one of the common public transportation in the world. In my knowledge, every country has trains. Whether peopel use it for the products or humans, there is no transportation can replace it at all currectly. There might be some news show up, but trains are still the transportation that very close to people. Therefore, it can be remained but need to be improved.For some people, train can not be replaced by other kinds of transportations. Especially in the countryside, the public transportations are not as various as in the urban. People who live in the country side might notice that there are many and enough train station in their neighborhood but they do not work well. Government built them but do not make them worthy. For example, seldom trains stop at the station that is close to communities. Owing to take care of all the people, including the ones from the countryside, this should be improved.A good working transportation needs to be effient. Unfortunately, people can hardly see it in my city. The timetable works inefficiently so it leads to a rediculous condition that when there is a train, there are just few people tends to take it. Since then, the time table should depends on the schedule of majority, like the time people go to work and school. The trains should be increased when there are many people need them and reduced when there is just a few people need them. It will be more efficient and match most of the people's needs.Hopefully, the trains system can be fixed and improved better in my city. Though I am not living in my city, these suggestions have been coming up on my mind since I learned how to use the transportation. I am the part of the people in my city in my country. I believe other poeple think the same with me and people's life will become better when this transportation is improved.",4.16F15 LATs,47065,"Currently I am married, so I live with my husband. My husband is very tall and a rugby player. He loves video games and also likes to do physical activities. He works at vivint company. He is a technican designer.

He is always looking for service and when he serves others, he is the happiest man in the world. I like living with him because he always makes laugh. Sometimes with my friends he is serious, but when we are together we cannot stop laughing. He does not like to wash the dishes but he helps with the home dutties. He preffers to vaccum instead of washing the dishes. He is a gentlemment and I admire his desires to do the right things.","Currently in my country, the importance of family has been declined by society. The young people are growing without the knowledge of the importance of the family. When people understand the importance of it, their homes are a better place to be. People that know the importance of it have a different way to live. The principles that they live make them a better people. People of the age between 15 and 20 should learn how important the family is and how to make of it a better place.         Why should people learn the importance of family? What effect would it give to the nation? Well, first of all, a person without education is not helpfull for the community. Education is received at home, but what happen with a house that does not think that family is important? The family is a large part of a human's life, and without it we are nothing. People should know the family is important because there is where we learn who we are. When a person knows how important his family is, starts to appreciate the thing that around him and that is what community needs now!.          Besides the importance of the family, the nation needs to learn that even though some families are not a good place to rise children, it can be modified. It can be impproved. Sometimes, it is hard to understand why some children have problems, and people start to worry about the future of the nation with that kind of children. The preocupation is normal, but we need to know that we can fix those problems now. Some  families have hard to handle and that provocates a bad future for their children. If the society starts to foccus in how to have better families to rise children, the future of them will be brilliant. Everything can be handle if we care about the importance of the family.      To conclude,  If we want to change the horrible future that we are looking coming now, we need to change a lot of thing, but the fundamental one is the wrong concept of the family. If the society starts to recognize the importance of family, the community would be a better place to live in. This idea is not only for one specific nation or city, is for the rest of the world because this is really happening. A family without pricinples is not a good place to rise a child, but also a child without the knowledge of the importance of the family is harmful for the community. The family eas, is and will be the foundation of the humankind and with it we can be better.",4.16W16 Placement,54611,"Everyone has person who like to live with them. For me, i mostly like to live with my younger sister with two reasons. First of all, she always helps me to find and figure something. Second, she like to be with me due to we're very close brother and sister.          Her name is Yalguun and she is highschool student in mongolia. She like to dance and watch movies.  One year before, i graduated my highschool, she transferred into my highschool. Then, we spent time together at school. Sometimes we argue about lot of things, but i love my family and my sister. I always feel great,happy and calm when i'm with my family and my younger sister. For instance, when i frustrated and angry, my sister always help me to figure that faced problems and bad things.","Around the world, everyteen has lot of problems about their life and social. For my country, i would like to decrease the number of night clubs and bars. Because, teens, who live in my country, spend lot of times in night clubs. They waste their precise time that need to spend on study and improve personalities in night clubs.               In my opinion, decreasing number of places that have bad effects can help to prepare new strong generation for my country. While decrease night clubs, government should build more library and sport gym's for new generation. In my country, there are no good library which is perfect place to study and read. In order to improve country, parlamient should build new library and decrease number of bad places. For instance i have some friends that addicted pc games and alchohols. I think there are no good places that need to spend teens free time. There are too many places that have bad effects instead of library, sport center and pools.               The second improvement that need my city and country is prepare good generation and give them scholarships to study in powerful countries. If i were a leader of my country, i would initiate huge scholarship program that can help student who doesn't have tuition. After students graduate universities, my country would develop faster than it was. For example: my highschool classmate who has very high potential doesn't have tuition fee to study in abroad. Then he's studying in mongolian university. This university is just normal university. I think he deserve better universities, unfortunately money decides almost everything.                 In conclusion, decreasing number of bad places and building more useful places for students can really improve my country. Students are new generation who will develop countries and save world from some things. Such as crime, terrorist actions, hunger, pollutions, global warming. Assisting stundent by scholarship also really can improve new generation.

This is a wonderful city. Provo is surrounded by mountains on North, South, and East sides.Despites on its beautifulness ts needs to have an improvment, but not about  beatifulness or size of the city, but about public transportation.For people  that are my  age, speccially for people that are inernational students and do not have their cars, this city causes a lot of not comfartble situations.First situation is going to the university. Some students live far away from their building where they study. The classes start at 8.15 in the morning and there is only one bus that can take you from point A to point B. The schedule of this bus is not useful. To go to the class at 8.15 students need to be on the bus stop at 7. It just takes  20 minutes to get to the building, but students do not have another alternative to get the study building, so they need to spend a big ammount of time waiting for the beginning of class. Otherwords, Provo needs to have more public busses that help students.Second situation is going to the grocery store.  I live 40 minutes by walking to the grocery store. Everytime,  I need to ask my rommates about giving me a ride to the grocery. I depend on them. It is not comfartable for me because I need to wait for them when they are able to give me a ride, and it is not comfartable for them because it can bother them. All these uncomfortable situations cause moral and physical feelings to me, to rommates. Provo needs to have a big public transplatations.Therefore, despites on beautifulnees of Provo city needs to have an improvment in public transportation. For students that are my age public transportation costs time, uncomfortable situations  with roommates. Provo need to think about these situations that are not comfartbale for the students and make some changes about public transportation.",4.17F15 LATs,75292,"Before coming to the U.S.A., I lived with my family.

On of the ways to make young comfortablet to live in the area is that to have a good University. Some people might say that it is not worth to build and make a University because it costs a lot of money. However, it is ture that having a University make your city a better plave to live for young people because it gives them the opportunities to meet with lots of people and educations.First, young people benifit from having a University because there will be the place they can meet many people. Social community is getting smaller and smaller that it is so important to peovide young people to meet people. The percents of crimes young people is rising because of the lack of community they have. However, by proving a University in the area, they associate with many people and find the joy and purpose in their lives. For example, Masao was hopeless when he was young because there was nouniversities in his city, and he had seen many young people who went jell. When the city made a University, he was 17 years old and decieded to go to a University. He is happy being a University studetn and having many friends right now. Having a University gives young people friends and hope.Second,  having a University in the city gives young people educations and bright futures. Educations give people hope and purpose because they can come to know what they are passionate about and how they can serve others. It has many advantages in long-term consequences. For example, after entering the University, Masao found he was interested in human natures. Before knowing that he was nervous about his future because he had nothing he wanted to do. However, he is not afraid of his future anymore because he knows his purpose and what he wants to do. Giving young people the oppotunity to be educated is very important.In conculusion, it is very important to have a University in the city because it gives young people friends and educations. If the city make a University in the city, it will be a better place to live for people who are young. It is recommended to make a University in the city.",4.17W17 LATs,23301,"After I came here, I have been living in Raintree apartment with five roommates for eight monthes.

She served her mission in Kobe, Japan, that is the reason why she choose her major in Japanese. I love to live with her, when I have arguement with other roommates she always stand on my side.

They thought big city is a better place to live because there has more job oppotunity, better enviroment, and convinment transporsition. For parents, they want their children to have better education training so they work hard and save money, all they want is to guve their children a better life. When children grown up, they become a adult, they start to plan about their future, most of adult who age is around twenty all want to develop their future in a big city. Why people want to move to a big city instead stay in their home city? Due to these reasons - job oppotinuty and enviroment, cause people do not want to stay in their home city.         First of all, job oppotinuty is the most important thing. For a adult who just graduated from a university, he needs to plan about his future. It all start from find a good job. Finding a good job is not as easy as we thought. Even though you have a great experience, high education degree and academic skill, if your city do not have many good job oppotunity, you still cannot get a good job. For a rural city, they should work on their economy development. More job oppotunity, then less young adult leave the city.        Second, better enviroment to live. For a young adult, they all want their life is colorful. If a city does not have a good enviroment, they will want to move out. For the government of a city, they should make the city become better to live. Some of govenment spent most of money on something that is unnesessery and useless. For example, the pubulic art, painting on the street and beautiful but useless building. If they can spend money on other useful thing, it will make the city become a better place to live.          In concusion, the qulity of a city is very important for young adult. It will influence their future and their life. For my home city, I think the job oppotinuty and a good environment is the two of main reason cause the decision of young adult.",4.18W17 LATs,52289,"I move to provo 3 months ago and I love it. People are very nice and friendly. I live in Glenwood with five American girls, they are from different places from United States.

She is really busy during the week so I harly ever see her.Emily is from New York, she is tall and chubby, she has beautiful brown eyes and long brown hair. She also studies at BYU, she is so friendly and outgoing. She usually works in the evening. Emily gets along prettyb well with Alissa. Alissa is another roommate, she loves cooking and her food is so delicious, she is pretty good at cleaning the apartment, she loves watching movies and sleeping. She has a boyfriend and she likes spending time with him at the apartment. She does not like sports at all.Kylie is the quiest person in the apartment, she is always doing homework and I think she does not have many friends. She is studying at UVU. And finally, Kaori, she is from Salt Lake, she is studying art at UVU, she is my favorite roommate, we both like sports, watching movies and hang out with friends.","I am from Oaxaca, Mexico. Oaxaca is a very small town located at the southest part of the Mexican Republic. It is a hot and humid place, people are really nice and friendly. There are many things that I love about Oaxaca, for example: The food is so delicious and cheap, the tradicional music and dances are wonderful and interesting, the arqueological sites are so impressived and tell you about the ancient people who lived in the mountains, there are beautiful beaches and places to visit. Even though Oaxaca is a beautiful place to live or visit I think it needs some improvements. The education in Oaxaca is very poor, it is very sad but it is a reality, every year education in my town is worst and worst. Goverment and teachers argue constantly, the reason is because the goverment wants to private education. In other words, all students need to pay to get education. There are really poor people who can not afford it, teachers are really concern about it because the only things that can help students to overcome poverty in the future is to get education. That is why many of the teachers protest againts the goverment, teachers and some parents block the freeways or close the school.There was a terrible riot last year in my hometown, the teachers, parents of the students and comunity blocked all the freeways of the state, closed all schools and stores, it was a riot. The government sent police men, helicopters to fight againts the people, it was awful. In addition to that schools are not well-equipment and some teachers are so lazy to work.I consider that education is crucial, having the best education can help people to think, act, improve and make changes in the society, community and family. Education can make a difference, specially if you are a college student. I think one improvement for my town is to have a better educational system. College students would be more prepared to serve their communities because the programm would be adapted to their community's need. Students would be able to contribute to the people and help the town to grow. Another benefit students become creative and independent, instead of studying abroad or outside the town, they can stay in their hometown and help the place to be more productive. Goverment should provide scholarships for students, having education prepare students for the future, they can have a better job and provide for their future family. I consider that one of the biggest change would be in the teachers as well, teachers need to be consagrate to their job, well-prepared teachers can motivated and encouraged students to achive their potential and they also can have a desire to help others. In others words, I believe that doing these things my hometown can improve and we will see the progress in 10 years, I know it can be possible if we are willing to collaborate and make an effort.",4.18W17 LATs,40423,"I am married and I live with my husband that is from Brazil.

However, every week he goes to DI, he loves that place, the people and ambiance. Edson likes to walk with our dog Craig. During the Sunday, Edson goes to Church with me and in the afternoon he likes to visit some members of the Church with him partner. Finally, we have a good life and we can live very happy, my husband makes me happy, sometimes I find surprises at home because he makes everything to be great.","I live in Provo and here we have a large green area with parks, greengroceries, bank, stores, pharmacy, but some things to make exercises free in the nature we could have for the people like for example, popular machines that do not need energy to make exercises, more plug to turn on radios and illumination. Some people are very fat and need to make exercises to get health with fun and a safe place with light in case to make exercises at night. As a result, everybody can have a new health life near home.         In other country that I can cite is Brazil, they have a program to population that has less money. They can find these machines in the park near their home and it is free. The people make exercises, find new people, and get health. The most common people that you can find are the old, because they are retire and have more time to enjoy and avoid to be sick. For this reason, this program is very useful and excellent.         The people when are doing exercises, they like to hear music to help to improve their series of the exercises and can enjoy, having fun with each other. So, it is necessarie to have many plugs to get the radio, or charge the phone and surfing on the internet in the same time. In addition, some cases they like to use microphone to make something different like a dynamic exercises with personal trainer that help like a volunter.          Although, the illumination is so necessarie that the people can use the machines during the night too, After all day workking some fitness people like to go to the popular gym at night and for that they need that an illuminate place with safety. However, it is more confortable and appropriate place too. They gain health with fun in the confortable place.           Finally, when a  population is fitness with health, they have less sick person, and the government can save money to use in others kinds of needed. People can gain happyness and a good quality of life without to pay for that.

However, for people that are around twenty or thirty years old is kind of difficult to get a job after their studies in university. This is one of the things that Mexico should improve, its job market.It is always excited to see students getting their degrees, but it is very sad and disappointed fro them, and their families, see them struggling to get a job. Young people and graduated students are full of energy and potential, they are ready to share their knowledge, and all those skills that they got during their bachelors. However, the reality is another one when they starts lookin for a job, and they find out that it is not that easy. Some of them prefer getting an irrelevant job to waiting for a really good job. This happens because they also need to pay their services, such as rent, water and light services, their food, and so on, that is why they accept the first job offer. Others prefer to wait rather than to be in a job that could be boring or different. The process to be waiting sometimes it is frustating for them, so they prefer to leave the country, to join a family business or to start building their own business, even though it was not their original idea or plans.There are many good companies or government institutions that hire graduated students by applying several dianostic tests. Although this is a good option for many young people, the real story is that many old people are still working, and do not want to leave their job at least they can give their job to one of their relatives. This is very sad, but it is true. Every year, many people apply for these jobs, but only a few of them are hired because there are not enough room or vacants. One of the consequences of this situation is that young people put their personal goals in second place. For intance, if a student just graduated, and he or she wants to start his or her family, they feel stressful because of their finantial situation. They also realize that it is not easy to get a job, so it will not be easy to buy a house, to get their own car, and they cannot even think about starting their family. One of the solutions that the Mexican government could try is to expand the job market, they might have the possibility to change this situation, they can stop those fake jobs that are only wasting time and money; the Mexican government has not only the power to controlled, and to create many jobs,  but the power to create well-paid jobs, and jobs with quality.To sum up, Mexico has the odds to improve its economic situation by using its sources such as its money, its companies, its power, among others. It has the potential to increase job offers and the job market, so that young people could have a good and happy future.",4.18F15 LATs,32463,"In my Colombia i lived with my family.

It is proven that playing a sport can help peoples behaviors, and can erradicate baf mood; thats why I choose to control this problme by helping the youth in this way, that even when it would be something fun, interesting and awesome for them; it would also change their lifes. Moreover, as they would be able to play, having oportunities to develop skills, can be psychological or psychical skills. they woul learn something new.      Second, by having profecional help by psychologists would help them to change their problmes in a faster and accurate way, thats the porpuse of this idea. Help them to control their moods faster so they can't lose time, because the time is on us, we can't waist it. Everyday they will have the opportunity to be in touch with all this kids, and teenagers. By doing this, they woill recognice the kids that they need to keep in touch, in order to help them faster. Another important issue, is that by solving this problem, this kids will have the opportunity to help other kids by the influence that they are going to show.      It's a overall issue the lack of money, and this case is not an eseption, because this kids will need help to pay the tuition, and something else to help their families. By working in this school, they would have the enough money to pay the tuition and provide something for their families. They will work by clining the floors, swiping the tables, cuting the grass and taking care of this place.Also, we are going to expect so",4.18S17 Placement,01705,"I live with husband and two boys in Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia.

Most important thing is to organize the apartments, schools and kindergardens for young families, because it is so stressful and crowded in some areas.  Firstly,  building apartments should be well organized according to the population.  Because of everything is centralized in the capital city, a lot of people have been moving  to the city for better life and school for their kids.  The goverment should develop countryside area with better facilities and apartments for young people to live.  Then there would not be a crowd of movement to the city.   Secondly, school is one of the priorities for young people.  Everyone needs to go to the city to get high education in Mongolia.  This process influences to the city crowd.  There should be the schools or universities  outside of the city or spread out  within the country.  Then, youths do not have to go to the city for higher education.  There would be a big development in the countryside area.  Thirdly, preschool or kindergarden are the  major thing to worry for young people to live in the contryside.  There is not enough facilities for small kids.  Also parents want to educate their kids from childhood nowadays.  If we have enough kindergardens with quilified teachers in the countryside, then we do not have live in the big city.  Countryside is the best place for kids to grow up healthy and close  to the nature.  Finally, organising apartments, developing schools and building kindergardens are the key to improving young people's life in my country.

One of the change that I would make it is the transportation and the law of where you throw away the garbage. Everything  can help to have a better place to live , for you and for all the peple around you. First, people can be benefit, because they are going to have more buses for go home , work and school so the time that they usually spend it is going to be less, so they going to be able to use better the time. Also if the regulation of where the people throw away their garbage , it s going to have a positive effect in the enviroment so the polution it is going to be less in that city or place. Furthemore,all this change are going to have a positive effect in the health of the population, and in the city .Because if there is a turistic zone the city is going to be a nice place to spend the vacation. In addition, how we know if the place looks good and everyone help to mantein that it is going to be helpful for the population and the city. One example of that it is in United states for be more specific in Provo , because in this city , you can go everywhere and see that it is clean, the air is pure also the beautiful views are amazing because everything is clean and you can e joy your time taking pictures and spend it in different places to enjoy that. And all it is because the goverment of Provo have different regulation for mantein that. Second, the transportation is important for move the people of  one place to other , if we have more tranportation, everything is going to help to the population that live in there .Like we know some people have car but if we try to use the things that already had . Can be better for all, if the goverment incentive to the people to be healthy and use bicycle we are going to reduce the polution in the city so it is going to be a better place to live. One example of that it is the incorporation that the goverment in my country do for reduce the polution in Santiago a city that is in Chile. Because we already had a over population in that specific place and everyone use car  so that it is not helpful for have a clean envioroment. So the thing that they do is that in specific days they advice in television the number of patent that cannot circulate in the street that they. This is a good regulation that help a little bit that city. So, everything depends of the people and the goverment to have a better place to live.In summarize, we can say that if the incorporate more transportation and also they make more regulation in the law the city is going to look better . Also, it is going to have positive effects in the life of the people and in the enviroment , because the polution in the air is going to reduce . This effects cannot be seeing inmediatetly but it is going to work in a long terms. So it is important that if you want a better place to live , help in litlle things like where you throw away your garbage, because the effects can be helpful for everyone.",4.19W17 LATs,91031,"My roomates are very interesting people to live with because each one of them is very different. It is fun to live with them. Dakota and Dillon are brothers and they share a room.

Dakota is very relax and chill whereas DIllon is very crazy and funny, however both of them are pretty messy. Seth and Jared share another room.

Government has a lot to do with them and how they develop the skills that they will need in  the future. In my city the government tries to do a lot for them but I think they could improve the education and this culture of studying to be someone in life, they should promote free education and they should encourage people to study. Santiago de Chile is a big city where a large part of the population is concentrated. Although they have been working to give students better opportunities to study, I think they should promote this in a more effective way, giving scholarships and helping students to pay their careers more easily, inclusive giving students the opportunity to study for free. A lot of young adults in my city do not have or possess a bachelor's degree and it is really hard for most of them to get one; If the government would give more scholarships and facilitate students the way they can pay for school, more people would have a degree, they would have a better income and they would have  happier lives, this would impact not only to the government income, but large companies, small companies, and society. My city should encourage people, especially young students, to have a better education and to fight for it. Many of the people in my city do not think that it is very necessary to obtain a bachelor's degree. Some people gets comfortable just getting an associate's degree and this is all that they study in their lives. If the government would impart a method or program to encourage people to study, it would have a huge impact in society and we would grow in many aspects. Therefore, government in my city should teach the whys of education and what people could get if they have it.To conclude, government in my city not only needs to teach people why is so important to study but also they should facilitate ways to study to people, if schools were free, if they give more scholarships, society would have an important change. Society would be more cultured, people would have more education and a better income, as consequence, the government woudl receive more money and we woudl grow as a country. Families would be happier, they would have more amenities and more ways to succeed in life. Individuals would feel more competent and successful because they would have a better education.",4.21W17 LATs,16274,"Now I'm living with my cousin and his wife.

This would bring a lot of benefits for people of my age because they are in a moment of life where they need to move from a place to other to attend jobs,  colleges, home, apoiments, friends, etc. and without a good transportation system is difficult to do so. Also being in a city where trafic is a difficult situation to deal with, this makes life harder.  One reason for this would be a good improvement is because people of my age need to spend a lot of money in college. For example, if the person life alone, he or she has to spend money in food, public services, rent, books, health insurrance, cloth, and of course, transportation. So, if transportation system is good enough, people won't have the necessity to spend more than usual paying for two or more buses in one trip, or spending time they don't have in trafic.  This not only helps people to acomplish thier lives now, but also helps people to acomplish their lives in a long-term. If they are able to do all things that they have in one single day because they don't need to spend a lot of money and time in transportation, this will help them to be more focus in their goals and responsabilities to reach what they want. Therefore, with people able to reach their dreams, society is better developed and is easier to build it. People will be happier, will work better, and will have more resources. Another consequence with this improvement is how people will use their time. If they don't need to use a lot of time in a bus, train, or car. They will have enough time to spend time with their families, go out and enjoy life, learn more, develop another talents, help others, sleep well, make excercise. As a consequence of this better use of time, a heathier society is build it up. It is known that stress, routine, and spend a lot of time in trafic makes people unhappy, easy to get angry, and with bad health. So, changing that, will help to make all the society improves.",4.21F15 LATs,47540,"Since I came to the U.S., I live in share apartment with 5 roommates, and It is my first time to live with roommates who I didn't know before.

In the livable city, they may be able to be active person.  First, The government should let salary of part-time job increase. People my age need a lot of money to study at their university. Most student have a job to earn their attendance fee, doing their assignment for school. That is hard to maintain both their credit and health. If they get salary a little bit, even though they work hard, they are not able to maintain their studying so that society may be not able to find outstanding people who will work for company in their society. Second, as opponent, but similar concept of first subject, attendence fee should decrease. I know there are so many great, helpul teachers and professors in the school who will teach them.To decrease the attendence fee of university doesn't mean they don't have to get a lot of money as thier salary for sure. Some of people who want to study are going through the problem that cost is too much, which makes them hard to study anymore. It will trigger they can't have apportunities to being imploy in the company. As decreasing of people who will work for society, society can't have a work force to improve technology and industry. 20s people are work force and brain of that society. They will make a better city more and more by learning what they want. To better to live, to get better to make an great idea to set up a good society. To be livable means they don't have to worry about what they want to do. 20s people should be able to study what they like, what they want.

In these days, Rio de Janeiro has one of the biggest Young Adults in Brazil. It happens because one time in the past was a capital and also is a great turistic place. People that came to the city thought that could be a good opportunity to live there and make money. The problem is that today the city is with a lot of people and car, making almost always the traffic so slow. There are two reasons that Rio de Janeiro should improve the traffic.The first reason, people have to work far from the home usually arrive. People don't usually lives near of the place that they work. Almost of always they usually waste more than thirty minutes in the traffic. This thing became worse when have a car acident, or in other words the traffic almost totally stop. In order to solve this problem they should encourage people that work in the same place go togheter . If have more people in just one car, It will be better for the traffic and the streets will be less dangerous.The second reason, people take a lot of time to get in the appointments. Figuring out if someone needs to go to emergency in the city how difficult it would be. For example, people mark an appointment in the Hospital and they have to get there on time, but the traffic could not be helpful. Being late in appointments will take time of the person that is going and the person that is waiting. To solve this problem could be good if the government creat more trem stations or buses stops, in order to incentive people go in a public transportation. In conclusion, the Young Adults in Rio de Janeiro are waiting for an improvement in the traffic. In the city there are a lot of cars, that is not bad if it can be a full car. All things will be faster and less dangerous.",4.22F15 LATs,73944,"I live with roommates here at the USA.

People like to go there because they can see many famous places, they can see beautiful beaches, different and beautiful people, different culture, and that's why people like to visit Brazil. But we know that every countrie have their problems and something that can be improved, and Brazil is not diferent.There are some problems in Brazil special in some cities, people have a lack of knowledge in places that people call ' favelas ', and because of the lack of knowledge- people stop to go to school and start to do bad choises in life- people around them have some  fear. People that live in ' favela ' not all are bad persons, there are good people there, people that are trying to go to the university, people that are tying to have a good job. On the other hand, have people there that was there to bring suffer, they use a lot of drugs and sell them for others, they use their guns to kill people inocent. And this is a bad thing that needs improvement in Brazil.In addiction, to have some improvement in this area called ' favela ' the government needs to pay more attention in how they can prevent bad actions there and make a better place to live. One improvement that the government can make is to give more education for schools teaching the students about the consequences of using drugs, and using guns to kill inocent people. Second improvement is to have more police there to help the inocent people to be safe during the day. If people stop to think in a short term maybe them can not see a huge difference, but in a long term people will see less damage for the area that they live, and less suffer.In conclusion, all contries have some improvements to do, and Brazil is not different.

This is why I always hope that there will be some smart businessmen come to my hometown to change the situation by introducing some new business oppotunities or develop a new industry in there.       First, they can come to do some research on site and figure out the resources they would like to invest. For example, tourism is one of a great oppotunities for them, because we have the most natrual scenery resources for those who have lived in big cities with serious pollution for many years to come and get some fresh air and enjoy some wild animals tour which will be cheap and worthwhile both in distance and relaxing in a short term and spiritually rewarding in the long run.      Second,  I hope someone could come to my hometown to experience all kinds of delicious food that are as of specialities, they can register trade marks for them and  sell them to the whole world. Thus, it will not only solve the problem of employment for young people, but also very beneficial to the investers economically, which will also help the business running in a positive cycle for a long term.      Last but not least, the government should also pay some attention to the higher level education in my hometown. Those cities where have more colleges turned out most of them have a faster economy boost too.  Since college students are motivated by all kinds of creative ideas of living a more colourful life, they would try to participate different social activities to promote the consumption and this will also help to multipy the economic structure of the city. If the government could put more money to build universities in my hometown,  more children will be going to the college to study instead of going to a further city where they can't see their family very often. Moreover, it will introduce more higher education oppotunities for those don't want to go to a college in another city in a short term, but will enhance the stability of the society in the long run.      All in all, no matter what measures it will  be introduced to my hometown, it will be beneficial to the people there, and it is a double win both for the government and for the people at my age.",4.22F15 LATs,31540,"Right ow I live with my family.

Also, it has some funny places to go, for example,  it has a lot of cinemas, paint-ball fields, bowling  fields, swiming pools, ice skying fields, etc. Even though people may thing is perfect like this, there are a lot of things that can be improved, specially for people arround their twenties. Some examples of possible improvements are the transportation and job offers. A crucial fact in santiago is how do people move from one place to another.  Many people uses the public transporation such as the subway,buses, or micri-buses. Even though these are fast ways of transportation. Most people prefer to use their own cars. The main problem in santiago is that thre are to many cars and the streets aren't wide enough to sustain all of them. Because of that, traffic congestion is too high. If streets were wider or better organized, it would be much better for people that lives in santiago.Another  issue that has a lot of people concerned is job opportunities for young people.  It is extremely hard for students to have an apropiated job and study at the same time. For that reason people wait until they finish their studies to form a family.  In other places there are a lot of part-time jobs that allow students to work and study effectively. One of the reassons why there aren't to many jobs available is because there are a lot of grown people that have no studies and need easy jobs to sustain their families,. Because this people don't study they can work a hole schedule and not just part-time, wich is more convenient for those who contrat them. If big companies would think more about this, they would facilitate more part-time jobs for those who can't work all day. In conclusion, Santiago is a great place to live in, but it could be better. Some of the aspects in wich Santiago could be better are in transportation and work for people in their twenties. There are some ways to improve these aspects, but they are hard. It would require organization, sacrifice, and hard work.",4.22F15 LATs,78207,"The people that I live now are my grandparents. They are so speciall for me and we alwways are helping to each other.

My hometown needs many things to improve to help the people and especially young people that will be very differente but could be better than is now.        Fisrt of all, each city has a different kind of people and can be a littel bit difficult make some changes because not everybody have the same likes and also don't think the same. For example, I would like change the places that young people use to drink beer or use drugs. Now many teenangers are going to some kinds of parties that just go to drink or do bad things. I would like create a place where we can have fun but normally, not using alchool or drugs. Should be a place just to have fun with many things that we like to do, can be parties but like normal perties.     Secondly, other thing that need improve are the schools, because now those are just a place to study a little bit and the students can do everything, if they don't want to go to classes they don't go, thats why I would like to improve the education from the schools and everybody can learn more and also meet a good people there. This change couldn't like everybody but I think will be good for them. Meanwhile, the courts on the schools should be very important because is there when the students can have fun and also excercise, practice some sports that is important to be healthy and also this motive the teenangers to do good things and take care by theyself.      Next, some buildings need changes because they don't look well, should be modern and have many facilities for the people that want visit. However, everybody should help doing good things to make better their own city, for example, don't spoiling the buildings and also the furniture that have inside or outside, this will help a lot because if people help to improvee will be better to don't have buildings in bad conditions and also everybody will can enjoy this and use those buildings.      In conclusion, if give us the opportunity to improve our city it should be things that things that we know that everybody need, should improve places and things that we would like do or have, because it maybe like to other people so could be good. Also, everybody should help, may be not to improve but just to mantain the city in good conditions. If we take care of the things that we have it will keep stay there for new people or for our future. Maybe everybody won't be agree with some improvements but in my opinion this will help future people.",4.22F15 LATs,50851,"Nowadays, is hard to find a good roommate because in my opinion this new generation of youth people are different as mine generation.For instance, they are more ignorant realted to immigration, they believe that all the foreing people here in the US are in some way immigrate even if they are just studing at the university and I do believe that they have grown with that from their familes,etc.However, I am totally blesed because I found great roommates that have similar hoobies as I do, but also with an open mind realted to foreing people, one of them has served his mission in mexico, so he likes to practice his spanish with me and I do like to practice my english with him as well,regardless, our time, homeworks,etc.The other one has served his mission in California both of them americans, but as I said before they arent ignorant or close people about foreing people as most of the young people suround us.Therefore, as I said before, I am very blessed to have them as my roommates because I am learnig a lot about them.","Nowadays all around the world young people of each country want to study in a different country because of the job oportunity, but also the better education in those foreing countries.However, In my opinion, I would like that those students from my country that go to another part to our country to increase their potential would come back to our country to increase our potential in many ways such as, Techologically, in Health, in sports, etc.I am very concerned about this because most of the students that go to study out the country they usually stay in those countries because of the better salaries and the motivation that recieve over ther.As a result of that I would improve those two main reasons to make those students to come back to our country.Most of the profesionals after their carrier wants to have a good salary and much more if they have done a masters or a phd, so a good way to catch their attention to bring them back to the country would be, to make a partership with the Goverment, because they have the best salaries in the whole country,therefore, this would  catch the attention of those profesionals that want a good life and more oportunities and so on.But a big problem in those spots are that the CEO dont deserve those spots because they are polititians realtives or friends, regarless, their intelligence or ability  that in most cases they do not have.For that reason if they bring those profetionals that deserve those spots not only gonna help those profesionals putting all their knowleadge in practice, but also this would help the increasemnt of the economy of the country in a lot of ways.Another reason to catch their attention is the motivation that most of the other countries give them,For instance, here in the U.S is very common to be motivated several times by your boss or supervisor,with different threats, of course not everywhere, but most of the time because workers here have laws that protect them.On the other hand in my country workers dont have an strict law to feel protect it,so first we have to make that law stronger and then, we have to apply the motivation to all the workers of the companies because is more common be denegrated and badtreated by your boss or supervisors there, thats why most comapnies there have a unhealthycompetation that makes the company go down because CEO or people on charge think that they are the value main person there, and all that they say or think should be done it, but is not truth because the main persons to make the company better are all the workers there and of course a good CEO that would motivate with their example to all his or her workers.As a result of that with good CEO of the company the workship would be better because they would give to their coworkers the messange of 'work together to become better'that in my opinion is the proper way to run a bussiness.",4.22W17 LATs,57139,"Roommates Are Family      This last semester I lived with six roommates. My first day when I moved there, they said me that we were a family. This phrase was really awesome and I felt as in family. We are in the same age, two of them served as Spanish speaker. My best friend was Nate Clark, he is 23 years old. He is from Utah and served his mission in Nicaragua. He works at Centro Hispano. He studies at UVU. My other roommates his name is Blaine, he served in Provo mission. He is really fun and always has a smile face. He studies Mechanic at UVU. Also he is President of Elders.  Another roommate is Trevor, he studies Physicogy at UVU. He is President of counsil of Institute. He works a lot.  All my roomates are so spiritual and happy. Every Friday we went to the temple.

When you finish your high school you need to apply for University. The problem is that there are not a lot of universities. Every year 15,000 people don't have the opportunity to study in a Pubilc University. The goverment needs to improve this situation because if more young people have the opportunity to study, Mexico will be better. In this essay I will explain the effects like addictions and better country.      The first effect inmediate will be less adictions. Reciently I read about the origen of adictions. One of the experts did a experiment. The experiment was with rats, this were in boxes with two bottles one of them with watter and the other with watter and drugs. The rats drunk the second one. After this experiment the experts made a boxes with things for to do exercise. However, they put the same two bottles. The results were amazing. The rats who did exercise drunk always watter but the others how never did exercise they drunk watter with drugs. In other words, if we never do somethig, we could do bad things.     The second effect is the long-term, a better country. If Mexico make more Universities all the young people could be study and be profesionals. This mean more education, more oportunities and a better place. Mexico have a lot of products and opportunities. Mexico is a rich country. Just we need to study and raise our contry.     Finally I hope we thinking about this effects addictions and a better country. Mexico has the potential for to be a better country. Just everyone need to improve and work hard. I know that it's difficult but not impossible. We need to have faith and be strong. Now Mexico is not the best country but it can be.",4.23W17 LATs,24340,"I really enjoy to live with my roomates because their humor.

He knows clearly what to do in the perfect time. Everytime when we hang out in a group, without Colton our meeting are to bored. Than there is Ryan from California. He really is my body because we came to provo at the same time. Something really good of him is his talen in music. Ryan helped me to sing in a talent show at the ELC. Also, he really like to participate in all our ward activities.

Pinamar is a turistic place that every summer a lot of people from different places come to take summer vacations. Because this fact, how important for turist, community and especially young people need more activities for to do. There is tree main things that can approve this petition: family benefit, show a different interest for new people to come, and to motivate young people to enjoy their vacation.One of the factors that contribute to a summer vacation are activities in family. Having more actitivies as a family can help to create a better union between all the integrants. According to new statistics, Pinamar is the city that many families from different parts of Argentina, prefer to visit during summer vacations. Beautiful beaches with an amazing forest landscape are the perfect ellection to have peace and take rest. In fact, during the last 4 years more adults and retire people were the most people whose visited Pinamar. But, what about the youngest generation? I lived in Pinamar for my whole life I know that we need more activities.  I am very sure that this kind of activities will change the enviroment of Pinamar and will help families to enjoy their summer vacations in a better way. Families really need to have more fun and especially the youngest.Having new summer activities in Pinamar can show a different perpective of the things that this city can provided for its turits. One of my friends who visited Pinamar two years ago was looking for take vacation in the way to sleep the whole day. For sure, he got to have excellent vacations wihtout stress, but what about their kids. They were bored until they hated this city. New activities as public pools or games sponsored by biggest companies can be the solution for young generations. I know that bechaes can be fun but there are good materials to used for create new activities. In others cities around the cost of Argentina, people go for things that are natural and uncommon. This can be parties in the beach, sprots completaly free, or even public concerts.Following the suggestion before, new activities always will motivate the new generation. This modern and virtual world is prepared for things that kids and youngs to received another point of trate. For example, when I was more young, soccer was my passion. Just playing outside with frinds was the world to me. Now, maybe kids need something diferrent, and technology can contribute. I suggest that Pinamar should invest in activities where young people can enjoy and learn at the same time. For kids and yong people, summer vacation can represent the idea to be separated from school or the normal routine but they still can used this time to learn. Enjoying this vacation means more than do anything, I know that this kind of things will preapare people until they will back to their normal routine. If there is something that would help my city, to be a better place to live, this absolutely is having more activities.

First, In the past I usually just studied, and my mom schedule was to be outside for almost all the day.She comeback home until 5 pm. I expended almost all the day alone. That was good for me because. In my home always was an enviroment in home was with peace. Today I am living with six rommates and everyone have differents schedules and personalities. For example, I sleep with another girl in the same room, and she always come home late at two or three am. Always that she come she wake up me for the noice that she does, and is hard for me try to sleep again. On the other hand, I feel so gratefull for have this oportunity to leave with more girls because is a new experience and I can learn about everyone.

In the past nobody know whe was this country in the map. However, thos change it is because the are a lot of improvements that El salvador make for been a better place to live specially the young people. This changed was. The education, Created more spaces where the young people can improve their habilities and in the health area.First, El salvador in the past the education was very difficient because the young people do not have the oportunity to obtain education for the scarse resources. The young people need to start to work at the age of twelve years. For example, in my family my grandparents they just studied until five grade. However the next generation my mom she went to the University because the goverment give more oportunities to habilitate to have free education or paid a low price in the university. Today exists a lot of programs in El Salvador where the young people can study an work at the same time because the goverment recognize that it is important for the progress of the city that the young people can prepare for the future.Second, in my city in the past do not exists a lot of open spaces and programs where the young people can improve their habilities. For example for practice a sport or a places where you can have free programs where you can learn to play an instrument ,and today is different the goverment have a lot of free programs where the young people can go and improvement their habilities and not lost the time just watching tv. Another important fact is that today exists a lot os open spaces where the young people can go and enjoy of the nature in a safety place because in the past the violence created the scare to past time outside and enjoy of the nature or play sports.Third, Today the health in my country imporve a lot because in the past just exists a few hospitals and the attention was deficient. However, today in the health area El Salvador is recognize for their improvements   ,and the goverment is putting more atention and helping that everyone can obtein this benefit. For example exists programs where all the young people need to have health ensurance and the goverment paid for this. Another important fact is that if you are student or if your age is between twelve and eighteen the medicine is more cheaper.In conclusion ,  my city today make a lot of improvements in the education, health and open spaces for the young people and the long-term consequences are going to grow even more because the goverment is carring and helping the young people.",4.23F15 LATs,43182,"I am iving an apartment which have 4 people and there are three American roomate.

The both of bus and train only have 1 or 2 in a hour. Therefore, increasing number transportation is going to be good improvement.Second, there are few job opportunity for the students in my home town. Woring on college campus is not common in Japan, and students used to find their job in outside of their campus. They used to work at cafeteria, store, cleaning center, and etc. Students can choose job whatever they wnat; however my home town is too small to provide enogh job for all of students. Consequentry, some of them have to go next town to where locate 30 minuts faraway by train. That is difficult for  students to focus on their study. Therefore, my home town should have improvement about students job opportunity because that is going to be great help fot them.Finilly, improving the public facility that students can learn silently is required for my home town. For example, many students prefer to study at library because that is good to study. However my home town only have one small library and that is always fulled by students. That library is also used by the residents but there is not enough space and for them.

I think one of the reasons that young people want to get out from the city is there is nothing attractive things, and I think malls are attractive place for young people such as shooping, watching movies, and eating a delicious food. Thus the mall makes people fun and happy.          Another reason that I would like to build a big mall is for good economic. Nowadays, people prefer to spend time in their house due to no fun place.  And, there are not popular and famous place, so people who are living in other city do not visit to my city. Therefore the city is getting worse for buisiness because people do not spend money so much. However if there are big interesting malls, people will go out from their home or cities.

They would always say that I was the one who was causing the desorder, and I would always get angry at them. For example, there was an ocassion in which they left town and left a lot of dishes in the kitchen. Then, when they got home, they found a bigger pile of dirty plates and cups, so it caused anger in them and they started yelling at me. That day I had to remember the principles I had been taught at home and I willingly washed the dishes without rolling my eyes or doing any other action I knew would make them even more mad.

However, when a person has free time he wants to take advantage of it and don't waste it, and the many holes on the freeway that he finds don't allow him to be on time to wherever place he wants to go to. There have been many situations in which people get stuck  inside a huge hole and have delayed due to their situations, so many have complained about this issue because it has affected a large amount of individuals in the city, and at the same time, they have blamed the government.             Additionally, there are many people who have experienced a discussion with those around them.

Two aproaches need to be used; to build more public universities and lower the studAt first, building more public colleges will facilitate the for the youth to be more prepared fot the market work. Brazil in general has one of the most high taxes in the entire world. The government justufy tose taxes saying that all the basic need are provided by the government such as health, education from basic to high, endurance and leisure time. Those arguments are not completely laying; however, the practice proves to be different. Since the public services are not good or have quality, whoever wants better things have to pay twice. Everybody has astromical expenses in daily life. With the youth is not different, having parents that can not afford for a better education and not earning a good amount of money themselves, a lot of them cannot go to Universities. In my city we have being competing for the same spots in public Universities that our parents were competing in the past. The great difference is that we now are almost the double of the amount of young people. The particular Universities are extremelly expensive, just high middle class to rich can afford most of them. Hence, building more public universities, one of the things that still considered really good in Brazil bacause what is said is that public university has the best education and the best students,  will help more of those young people to have access to superior education.Sencondly, still regarding education, diminish the taxes for student loans would give them what they need to start their projects in life. Even if the government build more public universities in my city, the gap between the number of young applicants and the number of spots is already so big that will be impossible absorve all of them. Many would have still to apply for private education. One of the ways that could help those studens of not being marginalized, dennying them the right of education, could be the student loans. With lower taxes and more time to pay for them, these young people could apply for a private education and do not be in great dept to start their professional life. They will be able to pay the loan while starting some of their personal projects such as buing a house, buing their own car, having a family or even starting a personal business. Having opportunity of education but go on a great dept because of that will help much a person's future, so lower that taxes for students loans and give them more time to pay for would be a great help. The economy also will be benefited for more qualified people working for the country, it is going to be the pay back for those loans. Concluding, education is what can change a nation life. Investiments in education will not just help the youth but also the entire country. And in the long term, the economy will grow.

They helps many young people when they move. The buses and the subways are available until the midnight, so it is very helpful to young people when they cannot afford to buy a car.          Second, it helps when we are in a rush hour. When we are in the rush hours, this convinient transportation help us to go faster than cars. Korea is a small country, but there are a lot of people who live in the city. Therefore, when we are in the rush hours, it will take long time to go somewhere. However, if we use subway or buses, we can go faster than when we use a car. There is a lane that is just allowed to bus, so other cars cannot use that lane. This makes buses to go faster than other cars. Also subways always work regulary, so we do not have to worry if we late or not.            In conclusion, the transprotation make my city  a better place to live for my age because we do not have a car, but we can still use our transportation. Also it helps to us not to late when we are in rush hours.",4.25F15 LATs,85868,"Previously, I lived with my best friend in my high school on weekday. My best friend is beautiful and cute with an outgoing personality. On weekday, we always go to classes together and have lunch and dinner for all the time. She loves reading some literatures, so we always spent time together reading books in library at school. Since I love painting watercolor painting and oil printing, we always sat in the playground drawing the scenery we saw.Now, I am in America, and I live with an American girl. She is also a pretty and outgoing girl. She loves playing video games and reading fictions. In this case, for most time, we spend two hours every week playing video games together. She is a busy girl as well. She goes to her work at midnight. Her job is selling clothes to customers and managing the structure of the shop. Even thought she is always tired everyday, but she loves the way she works. She thinks that working in the shop can help her gain experiences for attending  job, and this may help her a lot in the future.","Improvements are essential for a city to enhance people's living qualities. If people do something positively, they will change the situation of their cities. In my point of view, my city will be a better place if people in my age change their lifestyles, such as reading more books, working hard at school and doing more exercises.To begin with, reading books is necessary to people in my age. Nowadays, more and more people play with their phones for all the time, rather than reading a book and learning more knowledge from books. For example, my friends always stay up late playing with their phones. Some of them play games on phones, and some of them text with their friends. In face, they do have books in front of their beds, but there are lots of dusts on books. They think that it is time to play, rather than reading books. In this way, many people in my age lose some knowledge about lives and virtues, which can be read and obtained in books. If they choose to read books, even though just an hour before going to bed, they will change their minds gradually. They will gain more knowledge day by day.Secondly, working hard is always a way for people to be successful. However, some people in my age think that their parents can help them forever, so they do not need to work hard. For example, I met a girl in my high school, who paid much attention on how to make up everyday in the morning. In this way, she was always late for class. Furthermore, she never did her homework, since she thought homework was useless to her. She thought that her parents could help her all the time. With some people who do not work hard, more and more people will lower their qualities of lives in the future. Working hard can let people obtain a successful future, or they will lose their ways. Thirdly, with high pressures living in my city, people need to do exercises regularly. If people in my age choose to do exercises after school, they will not feel stressful and tired for all the time. Also, it will help them complain less than before. For example, all my friends who study in America tend to go to the gym after class. Most of them think that because they did not do exercises previously, they complained about the hard work for all the time. Nonetheless, with working out, they adjust the metabolism step by step and live in a health lives. If more people in my city choose to work out after school or work, they will live in a positive and healthy life.In conclusion, if people in my age work harder, read more books in the rest of a day, and do more exercises in the gym, they will obtain many benefits from it. According to the changes of their lifestyles, they will influence more people who are older or younger than them. Gradually, my city will be a better place changing by people's behaviors and lifestyles.",4.25F15 LATs,50745,"I am living at the apartment with three roommates.

On the other hand, he is so lazy that he never cleaned the oven that he used. Once I cleaned it because it was too dirty with oil. He never lift his finger. I was so mad at him so I made discussion with him about cleaning. Then he said that he will take care of it. Except cleaning, I really like him because he always takes care about me how I am doing and offer me a ride if I have to go to the grocery store. Moreover, he introduced many native speakers to improve my English speaking skills.

They want to have more places to do many activities but actually there are not many of them such as cafe, bowling places and even parking lot. Also, I want to make improvement in my city. There are many plans for making improvement.          First, there have to be build more cafeteria to make much more improvement. People in South Korea really loves to drink coffee or other drinks so that cafeteria is one of the best idea to bring much more clients to the city. In addition, clients from other city could spend their money then the money would make improvemnet in my city to make it better than before. This can be a long term benefit, as I mentioned there are so many people who prefer to spend their time in a cafeteria and if they spend most of their time in a cafeteria, the income of the cafeteria would be high enough to make improvements.          Second, there should have to make more parking spaces. It is because people do not know much about the parking spot so that they just parked next to the schools or roads. It causes heavy traffic jams so that people cannot drive easily through the road. People in the congress should help to make more parking spot in my city.         In conclusion, there are so many things to make improvemnet in my city such as build more cafeteria and make more parking spaces.",4.25W17 LATs,49752,"I am liaving right now with Paul, he is my actuall room romate.

For instance, it has high busness buildings and a variaty of available jobs, and even the most conplex way of trasportation which is the ''Transmilenio'' ( ''trans'' as a transportation and ''milerio'' as a milenioum). Furtheremore, young people usually need to use this way of public transportation because it has a complex variety of routes which supports many people to be on time to their commintments including studies and work. Even though this system is very useful for more than 8 thausand people in Bogota,it has some isues that cause many conflicts between the users because. Moreover some of the soluctuions are not made because the system has a lack on investments. This solutions are re -constructing the roads and making the system itsefl simpler.    The principla problem that the system has is the bad conditions of the roads. For exmaple, your poeple are the principal people that are affected because these individuals used the system very often, and the roads have many holes making this system slower. Furthermore, because the constant use of the roads and the lack of invesments, it made that every bus have gotten damages and bad fuctioinig of the system. However, this system could be improved by making the price of every tiket higher. For instance, doing this option the system could have the enough money to repair the roads and the buses.     Another solutuion to the problematic about the system is making it more simpler. For example, the buses have a very complex organizartion of routes which make it congested in specific times of the day. However, One of the ways of getting a solution to this dilemma is organized it again. For exmaple, some buses could go more faste with less stops, and doing this approuch the system could work more efficienly     In conclution, there are several steps to make a big solution to the public tranportation in Bogota, this improvements could cause that in future years the city gets more dinamic, and with less probles, so poeple can enjoy using this system.

Goverment can give a training for drivers. As a result people would use public transport and the government would benefit from this.

A good way to help the city to be a better place to live is helping the young people to study, because if all the young people can study, inmediately we are going to have more security in the streets.

In this world, people always find things to imporve in order to helping people have better lives. Many people would said that our city should have more entertaining  buildings for young single adults, but I disagree that his point because less fastfood restaurants and more libraries are better than entertaining.       First of all, our city should not have less fastfood. Eating habits are very important for all of people, and there are many people suffer from fastfood. Due to the fact taht fastfood make peole more fat and weak, it is better for people to eat more vegetables. In American, it is common to see many fastfood restaurants in a stree, and fastfood makes makes America people have bad eating habit. In fact, peole do not need to eat so many meat on everyday. If people eat more health, they can have more energy to do their things.     Moreover, our city should have more library for student to study and read a book. Studying is always better than playing video games because people can learn a lot of things from the books wich make people understand more. If there are more libraries in the city, it will help people to read more book. In my high school, it is common for student to go to the library for the big test, and it become our habbit to study and read books in our free time. In fact reading can increase peopel's knowledge, and it will help us to have more high quility lives.     Finally, because increasing more libraries and reducing fast food can make our city become a better place to live, there are several things that government should do. First, governments should let ecourage people eat health food. For example, Chinese food is one of the best health food in the world, so our city should increase more chinese food resturant and reduce the price of the vegetable. Second, governemnt should Increase more libraries in some important place, and imporve transportantion to help people to travel to libraries.

One improvement I would make to my city in order to become a better place to live not only for people of my age but to everyone would be the transportation. Why? Because for people of my age that are studying in college, we usually need to wake up earlier than we should because of this problem. So I think I would implement a special bus for students that are going to collegue,  in order for this to work I think that we would implement a schedule for students depending on what collegue they are attending and how much time will it take to get there. For the people that work or that are not studying in collegue I would  like to start the construction of a train so we can have different ways of transportation. Right now we have what is called 'Transmilenio' and it is very helpful but it usually is one of the most crowded places to travel. Also we have the what is called 'SITP' that are regular buses and we have 'Taxis' but they're really expensive and for a city as big as Bogota it's not helpful because there is too much traffic. We already have what is called 'Pico y Placa' and it consists in that people that own a car depeding on the day, they will only have permission to transport or use it from 8:30 am to 3:00 pm and from 7:30 pm to the end of the day. This method has been helpful but is not enough, that's why I think we need to implement buses and train transportation in order to improve my city and to make it a better place for everyone.In conclusion I think that by making these improvements and if all of the citizens agree with this, it would so much easier and it would have a great impact in the city,  we all want what is best for the city and of course for the country.",4.29S17 Placement,26253,"I served a mission in Lima Peru so I lived with almost 15 elders because they were my companions.

The problem relies on the bad habits of people they are not used to keep the things clean or even deposit the trash in the right place and I think that part of the reason of that it's because usually there aren't many places where to put the trash in.I'm twenty years old and I don't have a girlfriend but it I had one I would like to take her into some romantic place near to the city and that's something that I would changed of my city we need better places to spend time with our loved ones.Another problem is the insecutrity, people lie with fear because it's really common to be robbed one in a month, every one would benefit if the security and the police was better.For example, one time I was going to school, it was 6 in the morning and I took a bus so I could get there faster, then a huge guy came and he started yielling all the passengers and he said 'give me everthin you have and if you do so I won't hurt you'.  I was scared that was the very first time I was being robbed. I prayed and he took our stuff and then he left the bus. I was really gratefull with my Heavenly Father because he had a gun and he was ready to use it. Nobody was hurt that day but everyday in Mexico city there are people having the same experiences and sometimes they don't have the same luck as me.Also public education it's not good at all, teachers don't care about students and that affects the way kids grow up, that make students decide to stop studying because they don't feel interest about school and bad teachers. Although not everything is good in my city I've learned to live with it and my parents have taught me how to deal with this situation.Hundrends of years ago the catholic church took control of everything in the country, they taught people to fear God, but eventually people stopped following God's commandments, and they became wicked, now the church of Jesuschrist is established in Mexico in it has helped me to learn and become a great man one of the things that I'd like to change in my city is the way people reject Lds missionaries if people listened more to their message their lifes would improve so much that they would never be the same.That would benefit not only my genaration but also the genereations to come, I know it because I've seen it in my life and I saw miracles by the hand of God so I know that the more people obey God the more they progress.Even when my city is not perfect I love it because despite every bad thing there, it's a beatiful place to live and know.",4.29W16 Placement,40649,"Now I live with a korean family.

This  aspect makes that when the kids become adults , they don't know how to find the solution on some problems with their neighbours and co-works. It makes our city to live with other people difficult. If they can be raised to be indepent person, I believe that our city is o.k to live even though there are some problems.Second, we need to change our thought on Jobs. Many korean people think there are some degrees on Jobs. I mean even though we earn same amount of money, one is good  the other is no good. For example, if you earn more than $ 80,000 a year as a cleaner , that 's no good job. If you make money less than $50,000 a year as a teacher in elmantary school, that 's a good job. Because most people respect you and it is not 3D job. This kind of reasons most of korean parents think their kids should go to university. They don't mind what their kids want to be or to get jobs. To go to university, this is usuless thing because they can't get a job easily. I think it would be better to find their kids what they like and want to be and concentrate on them for their life on future. Third, we need to make TV programs with English subtities in public broadcasting, so we can learn English easily and don't need to go abroad. It will save a lot of money and all korean students don't get stress to learn English as like me. If we can change three things as I mention above, I believe that our city can be the best place to live because other thin",4.3F15 LATs,18619,"Now I live with my wife. Every day we spend a lot time together, and I know her personality very good. Often she thinks that I know her better them my self.      My wifes name is Cassandra, she is very nice person. Often she wants to help to everyone in the world. She is very beautiful. Her blue eyes smile to me all the time ,and sometimes I think that I never saw her sad.       Cassandra has a lot of interests. She likes play sports and hiking. Most favorite of her sports are soccer and kickball. Ussually we go hiking to the 'Y' on the mountain or to the lake. We togeter very enjoy swimming.      My wife is very busy person. She works more than me and study more than me, and after all she always has time for do interesting things, like cooking or walking outside. Her schedule starti at 7 a.m. everyday except of weekend.","Provo is the perfect city for people of my age. You can find here everything you need. Ussually people of my age in Provo are students and go to school. You have a lot opportunities for studying. Campus, library, restaurants and other places help to focus on your assignments, and do your best. However, Provo is amazing city for people of my age who are students, but not for people who just living here.     The first reason why Provo can be better place to live is traffic. Often you can spend a lot of time for driving from work to the home because main streat always too busy. That's means that people who have the families, loose a lot of time, which they would spend for their families. Some people trying to find another way to drive home faster. For example, people first drive on the freeway and after that drive home from the freeway. In onclusion, traffic situation in Provo not very good, when it is football game or some event, it is impossible to drive fast in  the city.     The second reason why Provo needs improvements is temple lines. When people want to do temple job, usually they spend a lot of hours in line.  If in Provo have had been built one more temle, people would not spend a lot of time in lines and would be more happy. Sometimes people drive far away to find another temple, but it is waste of time. In conclusion, Provo has only one temple and a lot of students and missionaries who often visit temple, so church shoud create one more temple.In conclusion, main problems in provo related with time. It is problem to plan something if you don't know for shoore how much time you will spend in temple or drive home. However, it is just little details, I like Provo. It is very beautiful city with great people.",4.32W17 LATs,10420,"Since I came here I didn't have so many friends but a couple days ago I moved to Riviera aprtaments and I met my roommates.They are very kind and nice with me.Also,in  Elc I met many people from my class from another countries around the world.They usually hang out with me and my roommates to eat ice cream.Furthermore,I know that I need to meet more American people to imporve my English and be more confident speaking.           However,the best person I have met here is my boyfriend.He calls Sam.He is from France,and he helps me every day.He gives me ride for every place that I wish to go,he always take care with me.For example,If I'm sick he came to my home and cook for me or buy some medicals.Also,he has the best hug ever and makes me feel very happy.Because of him my English is getting better every minute.          In conclusion,the best part to met all these people,especially my roommates is because I can speak more English and learn every single day with them.Also,my knowledge about American or others culture is growing up every day.I hope my friendship with them take a more time.","In my city,Fortaleza, a few years ago the president of the country haven't pay attetion to north of Brazil.Because of that a lot of people who live there have passing many problems likely house without water,children without education,problems in the traffic,the city with bad instruction,and people without job.One of these reasons is the govermet of Brazil has corruption and they are not honest with Brazilians.However,the goverment of my city is now trying to fix all these problems,which it had began many years ago.One of the most important problems they are trying to get better is transportation and problems in the traffic.        In fact,the govermet of Fortaleza decided to do something for the city trying to help people waste less minutes waiting for bus,taxis,long times in traffic in the car addition some rules and creating more suggestions for Brazilians.The govermet have been thinking about the city will be a better place if they fix that.Also,fixing it people could have more time to work and have more opportunities in life.       In addition,some of the creactions of the goverment were fixing terminals of bus ans trains,open more steets,put more rotes of bus,building subway under the city,open streets for bicycle with bikes chatters,and also they have working in the security of the city so,then,people can be more confident to use the transportation like bus and train in the city making the traffic of Fortaleza better and without accidents.      In conclusion,solute problems of traffic is not enough to make my city and my country better.The govermet needs to work hard with that.The education,the health of many people in my country is getting worst.On the other hand,the transportation made difference to many people lives and helped Brazilians have more time to do useful things for the country.",4.33W17 LATs,75708,"my new family             My new family in Unite State. all people sometimes change the place when live, in my case is the same.

One of the most important thing in the world is the education, all people need study, all people need impruve their skills.  one improvement woul make my city a better place to live is free education for all people and all ages. Free education is important and  has a lot of benefits for young people, two of they are  social equality and, more opportunities in the life.            social equality for education. First, sometimes people can't study in some universities or schools, and this is for one of the most commun rasons ' money'.  for example in my country Chile, this is one of the bigger problems. the best colleges, universities, institutes, or schools  are very expensives and not all people can acces to study there. In addition, People can be better that the people studying there but they dont have the opportinity for the money . if we have free educaction all people are able to be better, have the best education, and the same opportunities. the money can't be an impediment for anybody. for that reason we need free education, and with education we can have a social equiality.           Education give me more opportunities. sometimes not all people can study and just work in any place, and that is for they dont have the opportunity to study, if we have free educaction all people can study, all people can be professionality in differents carrer. Also if the people have the opportunity to study in a future that person have more opportunities in the life, better jobs, better opportunities to have money , and he can improve her life. if the people have free education the world change, bacause we have more people happy , working in places that they like. with free educaction we have more opportunities in the life.         In conclussion For that reasons it is important free educaction, and for people with my same age is most imprtant because we just need study and focus in study, and may be just used our money in the future with our families and not all for our education. social equality and, more opporunities are two of the benefist if we have free education. Life is very short and we need enjoy our time here, we need to impruve ours lifes every day, we need study for be better, study for our future, knowlegde is the unique thing that we have when we die, that is the most importan, and money can't be an inpediment.",4.33W17 LATs,47414,"my family are the people whom I am living in provo utah since dicember the last year.

For this reason the best improvement is the excersice every single day. this is the best improvement because you can have better feelings  with your body doing your activities, you can feel comfortable with your effort to have a athletic body,  also can help you with your health and overall we can erradicate among the people  the discrimination to others.             First of all doing excercise is a method to increase your abilities to do everything, you can have more energy and also you can do the things as quick as your body can.  for example if you are working and that job requires your energy to run or to move something to another place, but you dont have the sufficent energy o capacity to do it and if you dont do it you will have problems in the future. In addition this improvement will help the society to have a inmediate effect such as more energy in your activities and with the long- term consequence you can have a healthy body, so in the future you can attain your goal, reach your dream, and overall have a long life to enjoy with your family and with your friends.            Second, discrimination is a proble that we have in the society. we often think that is normal to jugde of to offend someone else. but instead of that we should think that all have different thought, ideas and actions and we must be comfortable with everyone. we all know that this is difficult to change that is the reason that we should change the attitude of the people in the city to do excercise, this will help everyone to live without problems, such as discrimination. one important thing with this is that you can have more friends. for example in you are in a new school to study, sometimes the other students bother the guy who is different, but is this person have a good confidence of itself can have more friend in the future. this is one of the long term consequence, and the inmediate consequence is to have confidence.In conclusion, do excencise is the improvement that will change the city, that would make a better place to live without discrimication and to have a healthy body.  Do excercise is the best way to help the society to have a better workers and to have less problems with health such as diabetes. therefore,  we should see this improvement as a tool to change our thoughts and actions with others, to have a good relationships and to have a good life with our families and friends. these are the benefits of doing excercise every single day.",4.33F15 LATs,79490,"Living with someone who are not a memeber of your family needs efforts.

For my generation, we sometimes talk about public tranportation. In my hometown, bus is the only public transportaion. Many people say that the number of bus and end time have problems. People say that more buses and extended time will make our city better. Saving time for going schools and companys, and serving convient lives for people are the reasons.     One of my firends who uses buses every day for school, she always says that she hates morning rush. In my city, bus is the only public tranportaion, so in the morning, there are so many people in fornt of the bus stop. However the problem is there are not enough number of the bus. Usually, bus drivers take passengers as many as can. Poople can't move at all. If a driver stop the bus surddenly, it is dangerous. If there are more buses for rush time, it won't be happend.      For more convient life, ending time should be extended. The last bus ends at 10:30 p.m.. Sometimes I should hae to ride a taxi. However, the taxi fee is really expensive that time. For colleague students, it is so hard to catch the bus. If I have to study at library with my classmates for a group project, we can't countinue because of the time.  The city, which I studied has buses since at midnight, so I could study more. Moreover, there are many travlers in my city. They usually say the bus time is to short. For more convieince life, the time should be extended.     In the conclusion, extended bus hours and number of the bus are needed. If there are no enough bus for people, it is may inconviencent. For people live in the city and the others, bus time and unmber should be extended. People who visited my city always mention about this problem. For making better city, it should be changed.

Many people around the world have so many problems and they need to have a big  change in their lifes. One of the most important things is to know what kind of place for live is the best one for them, wht kind of change society need on this days. There are two important things that people need to know and society need to change just for to have a better place to live, the firt thing that they need to change is paceful of the population and the other one is the security.One of the most important thing is the place that will be better for the people is the place that have too much peace for them. In this days people are afraid for many things, everyones have too much problems as a result of that they never have peace in their lives. For example, in some countries around the world need to have a program for the society to help them in some kind of things. On this days pooverty increase too much and goverment needs to help their population. In fact, individuals need to have a oriantation of the best things that they can do for their benefits. In the other hand, people sometimes don't care about the things that they need to resulve. The other kind of place that can be better for individuals need to have a big feeling that they are save in that place, in other words is about the security. Some countries in this days are in wars and many people that live in this kind of countries are afriad for their lifes. A best place to live is the place that have security for their habitants.

I live in Lima all my life and It is a really big and crazy city. One of the problems in Lima is the less of importance the goverment give to practice sports . This problem happen a lot of years before and anyone have a specific solution for this problem. There are many reasons for why the goverment need to improve the conditions for practice sports in Lima.                  First, practice sport help people of different ages. A lot of people around the world like practice different sports because sports have different benefits for their body and their health. This benefits not are only for children ,althought It is for people who is adult too. Benefits such us improve the quality of life they have, be more healthy, be more active, etc. If the government improve the conditons for practice sports an hel people form different ages to have a better life.               Second, practice sport can unify families.Lima is a big city but It does not have a lot of space for recreation. These spaces are neccesary for improve the connection between families. A lot of family spend time in the weekend for be togueter and do different activities.

They would benefit from this change because they need something that can guide them. The Temple is a good example of guide and light to everyone. Temples are the house of the Lord and for instance, it makes people want to be better. This is the best place that my city would have for many reasons.   First of all, Temples are the house of the Lord. Nothing impure can dwell on the presence of him. Temples make people feel the wish to be better day by day. If the people of my age, -specially people that aren't LDS,-see the temple , i'm pretty sure that they are going to have the wish of go to the temple and they are going to start to have questions about it. They're going to see a clear example of light and righteousness on their lives. They're going to feel the wish to follow the lord. Their lives are going to change and they're going to be an example to other people around them. If all these happen, the number of LDS-member is going to increase and it's probable that in a few years, my city would have more than one temple. The number of LDS stakes is going to increase and more young people would be an example for their parents and families. The gospel will be preach for all the comunities in my city.     Secondly, Temples are so beautiful that it makes people feel better. Temples has the potential to heal souls by the power of God. It's only possible if the people, in this case, people of my age have the wish and feel of the repentance on their lives. For example, if a young woman LDS is sad because she had done something wrong in her life and she wants to repentance, she can go the temple and ask for forgiveness. Then, she could be heal and pure again. In sum,a LDS Temple in my city could benefit from it. Not only member of the church, but non-memebers too. Temples are the lord's house and they make people feel better because the spirit that they can feel when they're close to them. Build a LDS Temple",4.34W17 LATs,31051,"I live with two roomamtes: Holden and Breyden. I think these two person are my best friends.

These two universities always are crowded and make a lot of money. For this reasons, there are two particular points that my city should be change to be a better place for youth. The two points are: decrease prices of  tuition and more part-time jobs. If those two points are better, my city would be the best city to live for young people. Firts, the tuition in both universities are really expensive. If the tuition it's cheaper obviously more students will have the oportunity to study with out heavy and extensive jobs. Also, they would have more time to study because they dont's have to work hard to making money for their studies. In a long-term consequences the universities should be more popular and improve their facilities. They have more students that means more money to build a bigger campus or hire more proffesors.Another point I think my city can improve is part-time jobs. The majority of good jobs are full time and with long schedule. Students don't have enogh time to work and study at the same time. If a regular student find a part-time job always it's early in the morning or late at night.However, students should have the oportunity to get better part-time jobs because they don't have time to school and work in a full time job, that is impossible. I believe if students have part-time jobs they can be more independent and be succesful in school and outside school. In long-term students can finish school in a short time and our economy as a city would be improve.In concl",4.35W17 LATs,79814,"One person that I love the most is my brother Carlos.

Moreover, young adults tend not to be senbible with the environment because they can not see the real importance to have parks. For example, when my cousin traveled to Italy, she could admire that in every city were many differents parks and she was very motivated to care abut the plants and trees.   Second, having more parks provide young people to be healthier. It means that we can breath more oxygen and feel better every day. However, today's world says that the better apartment or houses instead of park, the better profit. This is one advantage point for contructive companies whose purpose is to build a lot apartment instead of planning big areas of parks.  Finally, if my city would have more parks it could be bridge to spend time out of home. In other words, young adult could have the opportunity to do many outdoors activities such us practicing sports, planning conmemorative events. For instance, in places like Ancona or Rome, it's very common to practice yoga in parks. This sport provides people to have a balance in their lives and also to be in a good mood since the morning starts. Another clear example is that people who has parks improve their quality of live by doing conmemorative events such as celebrating mother's day and children's day.  In conclusion, having more parks would provide differents benefits like admiring the nature, having a good health and spending time with outdoors activities. These reasons would be enough to start a better quality of life  in city.",4.35W17 LATs,92584,"When I came to the U.S I search a place whe I live.

It cause that people could be For example, some univeristy students does not space to parking their cars, then they prefer parking in private parking and it cause more traffic because they need traslade to one place to other place in specific hours. Lima need more law to organize the transit of car around the city, even it could be very difficult and gain some people's interests.          Second, law for the protection of envrironment.

She likes to watch movies and be with friends. My other rommate, is from Idaho, and she is a professional dancer. She dances all day, in the school, in the house, in the street. She is very kind, we are good friends. Also she is very noisy and nasty, is funny but I love her for that. Ashley, is the last roommate. She never is in the house, because she works all day, but also she has a boyfriend, so of course she is all day with him. She is nice, but I do not know her a very well because I never see her in the house. I know that she cooks very good.     This are all my rommates, unfourtunately, next semester we need to move to another apartament, so we going to be saparte. Also, Corinnie (the dancer one) going to serve a full time mission. I wish she will be ok because she is so nice and kind.","New Changes in My City     My country, Uruguay, is a small place in South America. Is one of the smallest places in my the continent, and also is very different in comparasion with another  latin coultures. Uruguay is charaterizared for to have italian traditions and for to have more old poblation than younger. Some of them are moving to another countries, because Uruguay do not have many oportunities for them.  Because of that, would be better if the government do some changes.    One important change for my country would be improve the education. The young people need more motivation in the school. Today in day, the education is not advanced, and many students are dropping school because they do not feel motivation. The schools need more practices and less theory.       The salaries are lowing every year, specialy in young pople. Many of them needs to work while they are studying, and some times, they drop the shcool for to work. If the government offer plans for students, or reduce the taxes to companies that hire students, would be a better country for the students. Also with this, the country can improve the economy and earn more professional people.     Uruguay needs more fun. Is a quiet country, made for old people. We have a lot of beaches and fields, but is not enough for the young people. The country needs more fun places, not like pubs or danger places, but places for to be with friends, or for example, places when you can listen to music or to see theatre with family or friends. Another good idea is to have talent shows when all the coutry can participate. I like this idea because we are only three million people and it is possible.       Many students need aid for to continue stuying.  Some of them lives in the field, far away to the city. Only in Montevideo, the capital of the country there is the university. Is impossible for many students to travel for to study. So a good idea is, to build other universities in differents parts of the country, for example in the north, when there are poor people and less education.      In the current days, the language is very important. Uruguay, have border with only two countrys, one of them is Brazil. We have many bussines with that country and is important for the students to learn portuguese. Some private schools offer this benefit, but will be awesome if the public schools start to teach portuguese for all the students. All the schools teachs english as a second language, but the quality is bad. If all the schools improve the english level, the students could be a better oportunities to get a better job and study more. I can not imagine my country with this!     The Uruguayan govern is very liberal. I think that we need more publicities for to help the young people to stop to smoking tobacco and marihuana. Also the alcohol is very popular and many accidents in the streets happen because the people is drunk. If we have more publicity and the price of those products are high, probably the people can stop to drink and smoke.     All of these changes I think are good for to imrpve my country and for to help the young people to stay in the country. Uruguay is a amazing place for to live, but if the government do this staff, will be a better country for all the people.",4.37F15 LATs,42312,"Mony years ago, I was living with my family and sometime I will really miss in that time. My family have 5 members, my sisiters and my parents. They have different personlities, my parents are really  serious and my sisters are always happy or doing some crazy things. My perents have own compony, so almost every days they need to work. They sell oil and oil product. Alos, my sisiter are still students, both are high school students. They usually every mondsy to firday  go to school, and they usually go to school 7:30am until 9:00 pm go home. In addition, I think my sisters are beautiful, my parents too. All in all, I love my family, they are my treature,and I so miss them.","Most people love their city, and some people don't like their city. Usually the main reason is they complain too much, and forget the good things. In my thinking, My city almost prefact, I don't want complain my city or want change somethings. But if  I can contural my city I will change two things: traffic and foods cost.     In every cities traffic always is a big problam, because people usually don't follow the laws and the polic can't contural every problams. In my city have same problom. Also, this is the main reason young age people don't want buy cars, because if every week they have a car accdient, they will not have any money. So if the laws can change more serious and every people can follow the laws, I think that will make people love their city.      Money is the most important in most people live, and if they living a everything are expansive city, they will not love their cirty. In my city, almost everything is too expansive, and foods is the most expansive things. People need foods, everyday we spend money to buy foods, but what if your city foods is the most exoansive things? You will hate your city. Also is not good for young age people, because usually they don't have a lot of money. Therefor, if we can change the foods cost like other cities, they will good for everyone, and I think the young age people will love this city more.          In conclusion, in my city if I can change something, I will change the traffic and foods cost ;because if we don't change these things, people will die. The traffic is dangeous, the foods is too expansive. We will die in car accidents or no food to eat.",4.37F15 LATs,24533,"Beautiful Days                            I lived together two Brazilians and one spinish last semester at my US apartment. They are liveing at different apartment now, but those days when we lived together was great days for me for several reasons. They were the ELC students, and their levels were above me. Therefore, they were always helping me when I had English questions.Unfortunatlly, they are working now and went back home now. Moreover, they tought me  lots of American cultures for me when I came to the apartment at the first. Before I came here, I've never stay with other countries roommates at other country. Therefore, the knowledge what they tought me helped me a lot. And also, we had parties many time with our country foods. I was so happy because they loved my Japanese foods every time. I will never forget those beautiful days what spent a long time with my beautiful and funny roommates at foringh country.","Many people who is same age as me are living at far place from our parents now because sometimes, they want to find a good place for them education or jobs. Moreover, my local city doesn't enought system for young people's activity. Therefore, the city will change to be for young adalts to help their life. Some local people don't think the new improvement don't need for the city. However, young people will help our city a lot in the future. I think the improvement will help for young adalt such as educations, jobs,and holidays.                              One of benefit what young adalt will receive a benefit from the improvement is they will get a good education easily. Sometimes, people can't get a good and high education because ofe money at thier studant era. However, new system will help them and give them a chance to re-education. My friends who is elder than me at university era couldn't go to the university when he was 18 years old becaouse of economy. Therefore, he didn't give up to study, and he could go to the university when he was 28 years old, and now he is working at the high school as a English teacher. The improvement will help to not make people like him any more. And if people could take a good education, they will get a high selary and response to the city.                             Other benefit is their job. If they couldn't get a good education, they won't get a good job anymore. However, the city could help them from the situations. The city make good jobs for them, they will work there for several years. And, they make money for educatio, they will go to school again or they will save the money for their children. My one of high school friends is working now to go to University. She wanted to go to university, but she was so poor and the city couldn't help her. Now, I think she wasted the time to study. I hope the changing will people like my frined.                             People need to make a good holydays to live a life enjoyable. However, sometimes sity doesn't have any activity for them. The goverment don't need to make a new park for them, but they need to make good events for them. If young adalt will be enjoy the them holidays, they will stay the city for a long time. And, maybe they will make a family at the city. If poplation improves, the city is bigger than before quicly.                             The changing will help people who is same age as me from education, jobs, and holidays. Young peope is a hope of the world because they will make a future. If they leave from the city, the city can't improve anything. However, the changing has dengerous part too, so goverment needs to think about some problems. However, I think the city will help young adalt is rising, the city will improve quickly.",4.37F15 LATs,69124,"My roommates.  MY roommates, they are awesome guys.

When we talk about technology we are talk about somethng what can change liives, cities, communities etc. Let's take time to think about it how good can be for our country, how better our country will be with trchnology help. That why the comercial always talk about a good effect of technology. Technology also can bring these graet effect to our country and lives. Cape verdean people really need  to help them improve and grown. technology will help in our improvement. First of all, technology is  help for our communication. We have students in all part of the world, they might need to know more about the country and how the market of job are.  THey might need find job before return to their house. Also, they can vote, send a suggesttions, opinion, picture. The technology can be very helpful for them and their people in thier hometown. Furthermore, we have a government they always will need the technology help.  For examlpe, when the Cape verd's President is at the meeting outside of country he can send mail or talk by phone call with his secretary and give a order to keep work with many others thing without his presence.  In additiion, technology is a big deal for education. Children can learn and gain more aknowledge. Technology provides resources to find every answer you need in same moment when you ask. Also the technology is what can help the teachers to prepare a better class and find a better material to teach the students. Finally, technology is the most pawerful warm in the gorvenment progress. The influencial leaders should used the technology to strenght their economy and communities. By used the techonlogy they can find the way to get to know more about their people thought. They can find many way to serve them and help them. As india bring used the technology to bring them to a new world, to help them with a morden lives Cape verde should do the same. That's is the effert which will help Cape verde to grow more and more. Clearly, Cape verde's leaders should think about technology . In other word, they should start to use the benifity of technology. It's helpful and wil help into the development of our country. Incloncusio, Cape verde need  help and technology is what can help us in this moment.

My siblings and I grow up with tender care and good discipline. They teach us the gospel and the best way to be a good person. Always they traid to be sweet and in the same time right.

They love gospel and share the best blessing with us.","One improvement that would make my city a better place to live for people my age is a new health plan  I mean more open place for work in a hospitals. That it is a good idea because my city have a lot of professional in health care and many do not have opportunities to develop their profession,  other rason is create a new places to develop better economy and finally improve health system with new professionals. First, in my city are located three of the most important universities, many professions are relatead to health care. Many people who finish their career do not have opportunity to develop their profession because always ask for experence and have only a few positions. People with more years and experience have more chances to cover that positions and young professionals continuing work in something not releated to their studies. If they continue working in that work start to forget knowledge and lose skills. If the goverment start a program with that kind of people all the population win in health and opportunities. I thought in the first time of the program we need to gain less money, but it a good inversion in experiences.Second, if in my city will create many new places where we work, we have more money to spend in market places and that increase economy. When more people have more money all market change and appear new needs and more new job positions.Finally, new blood is always good. New people refresh our work places, we have new techniques or ways to do the job and we have new strengh and more iniciative for working. Probably, new professionals have more pacience with patients and more curious about illness and cure.In conclusion, that idea in my opinion improve a lot the health system in my city and bring more opportunities to develop economy and people. In my city have a lot of procrastination and burocratic proccess. Probably that idea will be very succesful but need a lot of work and money. Develop a new hospital in where only working new professional with one or two high degree in every specialities like a university place but with graduate people with less income but with many opportunities to gain experiences.",4.38W16 Placement,86170,"My favourite roommate so far was a friend named Marcos and we called him Markitos, to differenciate him from my older brother who has the same name. He's as tall as I am, white skin and blond and curly hair. He was a lot of fun, we spent a lot of time playing, watching and talking about soccer it's our favourite sport and it's been hard to find someone that likes soccer as much as we do, specially here in the United States. Another thing we had in common was our careers, we were both studying engineering, he was studying civil engineer and I was studying electronical engineer and even though these careers are very different we where both on our first year so we had a lot of classes in common, like Calculus, Mechanical physics, Linear algebra and so on. He moved out when he received his mission calling to serve in Chile, and he's been in the mission for 17 months now so he will be returning soon, however I won't be able to have him as my roommate again since he'll be 9000 miles away.","I think there is on main problem with my city, the city of Montevideo, and that is: security. Starting with security, the city has had a significant increase in violence in the last 4 years and it keeps being ignored by the goverment despite the fact that most polls show that it has increased by nearly 30% and arround 90% of the people living there agree that they don't feel safe anymore. The improvement proposed by Lacalle Pou, a politician who was running for office last election but lost, was that goverment should stop giving money to people that is on goverment programs and dedicate that money to build more jails and improve the police force. His proposal is very logical, population is growing and so is crime, we can't expect that the jails will hold as many criminals now when they where built in a time that crime was the lowest. And while I think his proposal will help a lot, I don't think it's enough. One more thing that I would add to that is to stop restricting the police force when they are dealing with criminals, for example, there was an implemented law in 2013 that prohibited policeman from shooting an armed threat even if he was aiming the gun at them or at a civilian. There are many more examples about how the law in Uruguay protects the criminal more than the law abidding citizens including police officers, who are out there risking getting shot every day by these people.If both of these politics should happen to be implemented I think the change would be immediate, when criminals think they can get away with almost anything that encourages them to continue with that lifestyle and when they get beneficts from the goverment because they don't have a job they are not going to go out there and get a job and help the economy. By cutting these benefits, improving the prisons and helping police officers to apply the law in a way that will benefit the law abiding citizen you send a message to criminals that the people of this country won't put up with crime anymore.",4.38W16 Placement,44411,"My current roommate is Sara, Sara withoout the 'h'. But I'm certain she does not make a big deal out of that (it's just that I like to know the right way of how to spell peoples names). She is a very kind and determined person. I admire her drive and nerdyness. I get along with nerds pretty well, maybe because I consider myself a nerd as well. Sara and I are alike. She has long gorgeous brown hair, wears glases (or contacs), enjoys food and reads. She and I have the same size of clothing witchis nice, because we can help each other out in emergency situations. I like that she is open and frank. Whenever something happens, we can tallk about it instead of walking around frowny and unhappy. Sara studies genomics... something like that. She leaves early in the morning to go to school or lab (she works in a lab and I think she's also a TA). Sometimes she comes for  quick lunch, but most of the times she just comes in the evenings and then spends time studying, doing home work, spending time with Isaak (her boyfrend) or reading. I think that one day she and Isaak will get married and have beautiful progeny. And she will also do great things in her field of study!","I currently live in Provo, hence, I'll write of the things that could be improved here, at least in my hunble opinion.The first thing I noticed to be missing is the infrastructure. Some people do not own a car and it would be great to be independant and go places by bus or train. Having more frequent buses would be beneficial in many ways. The valey would be cleaner because of less air polution. Being able to hop on a bus instead of driving your own car would save the trees (that are so hard to grow in a desert).Secondly, the ability to read or simply relax in a bus would benefit the students health as well. I hear people complaining about crazy Provo drivers and I think this crazyness comes partially because of all those young students who are in a hurry: in a hurry to get to their class, to that date or even to eat lunch. Many get tired after their studies and work, and therefore not really able to think that there are other hurriers.Continuing about the improvement of infrastuckture, I think more bus stops need to have these little glass houses to protect the people from rain and sun. Having a clearly marked bus stop would be also great to avoid missing your bus stop. A soft recorded voice that anounces the current and the upcomming bus stops name in the bus would be also of great help in this regard.Another aspect of the improved infrastruckture, in my opinion, and I dare to say inopinion of many local people my age, would be having bike roads. It would safe the headacke to both: the drivers of vehickles and the drivers of bikes. It would also promote healthy life style by helping people have at least some work out while going to/from school or work.By increasing the numbers and routes of buses, marking the bus stops and making them more people frienly, and having bike roads, the students in Provo would be healthier and happier students. I also think it would make Provo streets safer, because the tired and hungry students, and even the eldery people of Provo, would be prone to ride buses or bike on the seperatelly for them made roads.",4.38F15 LATs,62148,"There are 4 people living in my apartment including myself. I am roomates with Dani, Sara, and Emily. They are very different from each other. Dani and I have been friends for about 3 years; therefore, our relationship is very close. She has a full time job at the MTC. On the other hand, Sara is a freshmen student; she is the youngest in our apartment. She is usually never at home because she likes hanging out with her friends. My other roomate is Emily. She is a nurse and has a boyfriend. Hence, she does not spent a lot of time with us. Even thoug each of them has a different personality, we enjoy spending time together. Especially, we enojoy cooking and watching T.V shows such as, Friends. We are all very busy so is mostly at night when we get to see each other.","Mexico city is one of the biggest cities in the world. Even though Mexico City is a great place to live for young people, having better and cheaper ways of transportation would make it an even better place to live. Mexico city has three main public transportation such as, bus, taxi, and metro. However, the two most used in my comunity are buses and taxis.Although there are many bus routes through out the city, my comunity only has a few since it is a residential area. Most people have their own car, so there is a lot of traffic every day and at every hour. For example, if people in my city had access to a bigger diversity of routes, most people would use public transportantion rather than driving one car per person. This would reduce traffic and pollution significantly.Another way to make my city a better place for young people to live, is having the public transportation's prices more affordable. For example, there could be especial prices for students if they presented their student ID. Cheap prices would encourage students to use buses rather than their cars. Therefore, the time spent in traffic would be dramatically reduced, and people could use that time in many other ways.To sum up, there are two ways to make my city a better place to live. The first one is having more routes and schedules available for public transportation. The second one is to have more affordable prices for students in order to incentivate the use of buses rather than cars. I recommend that the Mexican government consider how much time the citizens waste on traffic, and think of how much happier Mexicans could be if they had more time available to do other things they like.",4.39S17 Placement,42058,"I lived with my parents and my brother.

In my city the schools are not efficient, the people there can go out and enter without permission and the teachers are not enough responsabilitier so the students can not see the study like something important and that affect in the future. When I was in the school, We had exams without the teachers and They did not come sometimes to teach, so We do whatever We wont qithout problem. Also You can see bulling and bad teens in effect of that.Something that I know is that, if the family teach the different values in the home, the teens can be more conscient about that problem and also We can see less bulling and more responsability in the school and then in the life! At the same time, the teachers need to be better in the attendance and responsability of the teaching. The people can be better if They teach better! So it is important that the parents teach good too! All the future can depend of the kind of life that the people have in the house, for example, I know that if someone ask in the prission to the prissioners about their family, probably They going to tell that their families are not the best, They did not teach to work, to be honnest and things like that. I know that if We try to change that all the city and the country can be better in the future.

In my city there are some things in one are that it need to improve in order to have better recreational places for young people and families. A good city to live shuold have, green areas, places for sports and theathers.        One improvement for my city is that It need more green places. Most of the people around the world really enjoy outdoor activities, usually due to the strees that came from offices, stressfull jobs or sometimes just cities. If one city does not have enough green places people will be more stressfull because they will feel that everything around them is just grey and with concrete. In my citi there are not too much green places, like parks or places like those, so I can see how people get really stress about that. It is really common that people in my city goes to a different city to enjoy their vacaction, because there are not places for that. In my opinion the major of my city should invest more money on green places for my city, there are a lot empty places, and nobody will against those kind of project because people really need it.          Places where people can practice sports will make rancague more active for young people and will make old people more healthy. It is proved that exercise is a huge benefit for our body and health, doing exercise three times per week can make a big difference in people's life. Countries like The United Sates, China, and Brazil, estimulate the desire for people to  do excercise, we can see that developed cuntries are really good with this. If we compare just one city from one those countries with my city, we will see that rancagua is too far from reaching that kind of modality. There is just one place in the whole city where people can practice sports or where people can do exercise and also it is too far and too little for all the citizens. My solution obviusly is that rancagua need more places for people realize active activities, it is not enough to have just one place to do this. The result of this can make a really good improvement for the city, more outstanding people would be selected for national competicions and old people would be more healthy and active than normal.   In conclusion, if my city have this kind of  improvement  citizens will be more active, young people would have more desires to practice sports and the city would have more oportinities to be an outstanding city in the country, this is a great change that will improve people's life.",4.41W17 LATs,98440,"Before came here, I was living with my parents in Ecuador. I thinks it's common in Latin countries live with our parents, in my case was the same. I lived with them for my whole life and I really enjoyed lived with them for many reason. I can imprive in my skkls in differents ways and I coul got chankkegnes form them. Also I could lerned about my life, thir life and had fun with them. Their like to do a lof thing. First, in the weekend their like to travel to another province and lear about their new culture. Thatr was the ways how I can develop knoledge from my country and know more about mny ancent. Second, I spend a lot time witn my parents so their always got me things for do in my house like clean, make food, or help my mother in the kitchen or someting like that, so that was the way how I learned about my responsability in my house, in my house and for myself. Finally, I develop my challenges because tehir always make me fell confortable and free in my decition and what i wanna do for my life, like waht I want to study, when I wanna live here in US and that kunda if thing. In my oponion live with my partns was mny best way for learn a lof of thniks and inpriove in mny lu","I am from Ecuador and I accepted live there is amazing but if that people want to improve something it could be the public transportation.  Many peolple in Ecuador have ther own car, but another percent of the poplulation don't have it one. Public transportation in my country is really important for that. If my country improve in this ways its going to be incredible and a good advice for the whole country but better for my age population. Why? let me explain you some reason for that.     First, public transportation around the word is ones of the most important thing for improve it. All of us know that part. If governament people improve this think my age population could develop their skills. How?  for example if their improve busses and buy moder buss with tables and more space student will be study when their come back their home. Like US, their have a confortables busses and a good arquitecture for do homewrok or study inside the buss.     Second, It's important have a schedule for take the bus and be respectufl with that. Ecuador have a lot of buses, the problem is their don't respectg anything. Basiclly their just drive people but their don' have schedulle and their dont repect the stop. Younger population is sffectet directly with this because almost ever transportation cause their arrive late to the school and their score down for that reason. If Ecuadorian governament improve this way my age people its going to be happy because their will stop worry about their schedulle or come late to their classes.     Last, younger population I mean student, almost ever take the bus for go to school and coma back their home.  Pucblic trasnportation is reallly polpular in my country, sometimes is the reason why some women are affected. Why? because the demand for take the buss is too high so in the bus there are a lot of people  inside sometimes,  women are acossed from men. That it's true and alarm because this women cannot fell safe if their decide to take a buss in that conditions. We have legal lays if men accost women but the political in my country is so bad. Sometimes women demand this kynda of acts in the police station but their don't do nothing. Basiclly if their imprive this way it could be ssafe for women I mean for the whole younger population.     In my oppinion, public transportation is important around the word, no just in my country. People who has their own car sometimes doen't know about this situation but happens in many countries. Ecuador have potential for improve in this ways and get new tegnollogy. Every thing depends to governamental people, if their want to get money for develop this thing, it could be a good advantage no just for some people, of cours it will be affect the whole population and my own age it's gonna be happy. I think this change will be better students I mean eficients student. Maybe their score will be high that another ones and their will fell confortable the most important think their going to stop worry for no important thinks in this case their will be focus in study and do their best.",4.41F15 LATs,63833,"I live with Mary Jonhson, a native people.

When I came to Provo, I didn't have enough money to rent an appartment. When she knew my situation, she asked me to share her house with very little rent fee. She is so kind and gernouse and treats me very well. Now we live with each other,  I help her clean house, do some landury, and take care her garden and dog.

As a huge city with more than 80 millon population, pollution is the biggest problem in Nanjing. Our government tried many ways to reduce the emossion, but all these strategies affected little. We still suffered from heavily smog.  For this reason, I will try my best to find a way to improve the air quility in my city, help people breathe clean air. I will call people pay more attention on environment. The best way I will to do is calling public to plant as many as trees.    Trees can absorb CO2 and other kinds of green house gases. CO2 and other kinds of green house gases are the main harmful materials which compose smog. If we have enough trees and grassland, plants will reduce pollution and clean air. On the other hand, trees and other kinds of green plants can docrate our city and relex stress atmospher in one city.  For example, the central park in New York is called green lung, and it is a very famous place to live. Many arts,  writers, and drawers express their feelings about the famous park. If I called 80% citizens in my city to plant trees per year, we would have great green land after a few years. And we will fight against the pollution in my city.However, it must be hard at begin. In my city, public and government willing to build construcations on empty land for money rather than create green field and public parks. Many of them say that we should earn money at first then zero in on environment. If I call they to give up short-term benefits, many of them will struggle with me. But for long-term, for example, 20 or 50 years later,  when the trees grow up, we will have forests and woods. And the most benefit is our air quilty becoming better and better. All persons in my city will get offer form these plants.This is my main duty to make my city better, I will try my best to call people focuse on environment and plant enough trees.",4.41F15 LATs,43938,"I lived my husband right now in America.

It makes us good feeling. However, I don't think smoke is good thing for us. I think that people should ban smorking in this world, it would make my city a better place to live.  There are two reasons that we shouldn't smoke. First, It bad for our health. Second, it is wast of the money and time.  First, I believe that it is bad for our health. Some people say that they are smoking when they have a stress and after they smoke, they feel better. I disagree with this opinion. I have a friend who loves smoking.When she was ain high school, she started to smoke. Now, she has a cancer, but she cannot stop smoking. Her cancer is getting worse because of the cigerrett. When she realized that smoking is bad for her body, it was too late. Through the ban of smoking of my age's people, it helps to be helthy. For this reason, I prefer to stop selling cigerret. Second, If you continue to buy cigerretts,  I think it is very wast of the money. I have seen people who is homeless ask to give them a money to people. However, they have a ciggerret. I alwas have a question for them. If they have a moner that they can buy cigerret, they should buy something that they need or they earn the money  for their future. I think that they should think of a way of using of money wisely. I believe that smoking is the wast of the money in our lives. Therefore, if there is no exist of cigerrett, we can have good life more than before. I think smolking make people that we age to be unhappy for those reasons: it bad for our healthy and it the waste of our money. Some people believe that smoking helps them to be happy and they can feel comfortable. However, I disagree strongly because it seems good thing for us, but actully it doesn't.

As a kid, I did not understand that it was a huge opportunity that God had given me to learn how to become a better person, because I am the youngest of five, so all of my siblings and parents had more experience than me.I have two brothers and two sisters, all of them are very different from each other but it works somehow. I feel like our personalities complement each other because every one of us have something that the other one does not have. For example, my older sister is very responsible, and that is something that I lack, so she helps me to fulfill my duties and responsibilities.I am the tallest of all of my direct family members. My sister that comes right after me is the shortest. I wouls say that she is my best friend, because we have this connection that is very hard to describe. We always laugh at the same things, we like to do similar things and we love spending time together.I would say that my oldest brother is the most intelligent member of our family. I just don't understand how he understands everything so quickly! I wish I could be like him. He is getting his MBA here at BYU this month.My other brother is the most innocent of all of us, he is always looking for opportunities to make people feel good and serve them. And, as I said before, since we are all very different from each other, I do not have that gift of selfless service, so this is something that I need to learn from him. He is currently living in Chile and he is on his final semester at college.","I am from Chile, specifically from Santiago, the capital of the country. It is a great city to live in, I would say that we have everything we need in order to have a comfortable life, but just like everything else, improvements are always necessary to keep improving our life quality and the quality of the city. One of the things that would be benefitial for the people in Santiago is more subway lines. We currently have five lines that cover some of the most important parts of the city, but there are other areas that need this technological invention in order to be fully connected with the rest of the city.I say this because there are many people who live at least an hour away from their jobs, so they need to leave home very early in the morning (at 6 AM most of the time) in order to arrive at their workplaces on time. There has been a couple social movements to promote the implementation of a new subway line, but the city government has not listened yet.In addition, the subway trains are not as harmful to the environment as the buses that are currently transporting people in the city. Santiago is one of the most polluted cities in South America, and this has happened because some people have not had the vision of how the city can be in the future if they do not contribute with simple and clean habits, but this also has happened because of the pollution that cars and buses produce, so less buses and more subway trains would be an ideal solution for this ongoing problem.Also, when people go from one place to another using the subway, they do not need to worry about their money, because they just need to pay once and they can travel as much as they want as long as they do not get out of the subway domains. In other words, they can make connections with other subway lines, go to the opposite direction, etc. Nevertheless, when they use buses, their bus ticket is only valid for one hour after they used it, so if their usual trip takes more than an hour and they need to take a second bus, they have to pay two tickets for traveling just once.In conclusion, more subway lines would be ideal for Santiago to keep growing and become a developed city soon, because even though it is already a great city to live in, this change would impulse it to be for sure the best city in South America.",4.42W17 LATs,61663,"I receive my current roommate  on december from last year. I was amazed because of the kind of person that she is. Before, I did not have the opportunity to enjoy the company of a roommate because we did not share the same principles, although there is a honor code.  My current roommate loves to read and serve. She works everyday at  5am in some offices at BYU. She is usually home at nights because she tries to finish all her homework in the library, or she studies at the library and comes home for her homework.She tries to be kind and happy with everyone.

She is the best roommate that I have had in all my time in Provo.","Having the opportunity of visiting my country after living for some time in the US gave me a different perspective about events. People living in a country for years get used to the service that their community offers. Costumer service is different in every country and it is also based on the culture. Culture can decrease or increase the level of kidness and education that costumer service should have. This specific field is the one that needs to be helped in order to increase the marketing for Ecuador and also to challenge the current society for the future.When tourists visit different places they expect to feel different and learn. Kindness is the door that opens opportunities. When people who work at stores or restaurants will treat the clients as they were the only costumers, they will feel different. Nowadays, one wants to be treated well and respected, but if they do not receive that, they will not answer as well. Definetly, if Ecuador would increase and apply a better costumer service, they will be able to increase the tourism, production and marketing.With a better costumer service, Ecuador will be able to prepare its society for the future. When someone receive something great, they want to give something great. With this new tradition in the country, they will now exactly what they want. The same will happen when Ecuador as one society change their costumer service, because it will lead to future changes. Thus, when someone will be treated with amability and kindness, they will want to share it and this is how it will progressively change future generations.In conclusion,  Ecuador will be better if some traditions stay in the past. Costumer service is a weakness of this country and if it is improven it will lead to many future changes. The society needs this example to grow and improve for the future. When the time comes that those aspects will be improved, Ecuador will turn into a better country which will challenge future generations as well.",4.42W17 LATs,04514,"I live with my family.

The taxes goes to the poket of the mayor of the city.  Also, they use it not in the good way. Usually, they spend the money of the people for their personal needs.  I would opine that if the coraption and buracresy would stop, my city and country would have better life.  First of all, if those people would stop taking taxes and using them in their needs, we would have better schools. Many schools in my town are old. Some of them builded in the USSR time. It was long time ago when they had good recunstraction. Most of them soon will fall of.  If the taxes was used coreactly, we would had a lot of new schools. Also, the money for the need of the school comes from the students of the school. Each year they gather money for the fixment of the school from the students. This money not comes from the goverment or from the taxes.  Also, nobody knows why there is not enoght taxes to support the schools.   It is not only a problem that could be solved without coraption. One of the main problems is hospitals. We have free health help in the country. However, each city does not have good hospitals. Only prived ones are good, but they cost a lot of money to go and to have health care.  Even though a one goes to the city hospital, the one will not resive good care from the doctors.  The one have to give some money if the one wants good care. The coraption is there too. Nobody want to work for free. Also, that is the problem too. The hospital have to resive good amount of money from the taxes that the city goverment gets. However, it does not happens. The last big problem that can be solved without coraption would be police officers. In my city we aloust never call police. They do not resive good payment from the city goverment, so they very corapted. They will do everything to have some money from the citizens. Even they will use their authority to gain some money. If they resived good payment, they would more focused not about their hungry stomacks and families. They would more focused on their work. They would more help citizens than try to gain money from them. This is my point of view how my city would be better place. The coraption and buracrasy is the main problems.

In my country, people need to recieve a good education. However, poor people prefer to develop by themselves. One of the improvements that my city has made is education. The goverment has built more schools and universities in rural places that have made a nice place to learn for kids and teenagers, also schools prepare kids for the future.Schools are nice place for kids and teenagers to learn. Teachers will teach them all the basic knowlegde they will need every year. For example, if kids learn the basic subjects like math, literature, and science, they will have an overall knowlegde in the first years of school. Moreover, kids and teenagers have the opportunity to meet or socialize with people of their same age. They will share experiences, play games and learn at the same time. In summary, school is the best place where kids and teenagers can learn in many ways.Schools prepare kids for the future. If a child doesn't have any educational preparation, he or she probably don't have good opportunities in life. For instance,  a person has to conclude their high school education at least for apply a job in my country. This job will make their lives easier because it will bring a health secure that their families can be benefice it of it. To conclude, education is crucial for any person to find job opportunities.In my country a good way to develop to improve is made schools for kids and teenagers, it will prepare them for the future and they will learn so many things that will be useful for them.

It has in comparation with other cities a good public transportation where the subway is very clean and used for most of the people there. Even though the publuc transportation has many advantages it has a few disadvantages that could be improved and would make big differences in the lifes of many people, especially young people that have to take the bus and the metro to get to ther universities on time.     Every morning it is a challenge to get in the bus. Most universities have their classes in the morning and when many people want to get in the same bus it is very difficult to do it. Not only college students need to take the bus, but also many people going to their jobs need to take the bus as well.      When during the day going from one part of the city to another take more than one hour , in the morning that time is twice the normal time. For college students it is very hard to spend two hours in a bus to get to the university. They have to study and doing so in a bus it is very hard or impossible. One of the causes to this problem is that there are not exclusive streets just for buses.  When many people are trying to get on time to the city center they take taxis, buses, their own cars and the traffic is terrible every day.       One solution would be to build exclusive ways where cars are not allow. By doing that the traffic would not be terrible and people would be able to sleep more, have enough time to eat breakfast in the morning, spend more time with their families, not be stress for taking the bus on time to get on time to their jobs or university and if this happen it would be benefitial for everybody making possible to more people use the public transportation and not use their cars which would cause to have less pollution in the city in people would be able to enjoy of the mountains most of the time are cover by smog.    People in my city are expecting to have this changes. having one or two extra hours per day to enjoy doing other things instead of waiting for the bus on traveling in the bus would help the citizen to be happier and be less stress. Building exclusive ways just for public transportation is a big change that the city of Santiago needs to have.",4.44F15 LATs,45381,"When I was young, I lived with my family.

If everyone were trying to solve it, every city could be a nice and safe place to live. Some of  the problems that we can find in cities are contamination, insecurity and  transportation.               Contamination in cities, one of the biggest problem that we ca find. At the first point we can say that the pollution, is the most common factor of contamination that we can find. Bussines , and cars are the biggest contaminators in cities. How we can solve this? here is the solution. We can start to not using  our cars and we can choose to walk or to bike to our job or school. What about bussines? They can create a plan to not contamined to much, so with that can we have a better air and less illness.                             Insecurity in cities. Some people can fell very insecure because the slob and bad people. Insecurity it's something that we can fix increasing the number of police. So they can go araund the city days and nights to make sure that everything is going well. for example if we don't have the security that we need, everyone it's going to be afraid to take a walk or hanging out with their familys.

It's something that every city need, If we have a good transportation, as a buses or metro, The city is going to be connected and everyone can move it whatheber they want.                              In conclusion. if we have",4.45F15 LATs,49771,"Currently, I live with three roommates in a six-person apartment. One of my roommates is from Ukraine as well, and we are best friends. We also have the same name and the same interests. Moreover, many people tell us that we look alike, which is why we often get confused for siblings. We both like to dance, listen to music, and draw. Both of us know four languages, and we plan to start learning German next semester. We enjoy going to rock concerts and cooking exotic food in our leisure time. We also work together, which is why we spend almost all of our time together. Two of my other roommates are from California. They grew up at the same place, and they are best friends too. One of them, Nikita, goes to BYU and studies English. Her dream job is to be a writer. Her friend, Grace, studies Food Science and is going to graduate in April. We all like to spend time together and visit interesting and enternaining places in Utah, as we all come from different areas. However, we don't get to hang out a lot because of our schedules.","Before moving to Provo, I lived in Kiev which is the capital of Ukraine. It is a beautiful city with many parks, rivers, museums, schools, restaurants, etc. There is also a great quantity of historic places and streets with ancient European architecture. It is a pleasure to live in Kiev. However, there is one thing that needs improvement, and I believe that young people living in this city will benefit from it. I think that there should be more sport stadiums and recreational places in Kiev.There are many families with young children living in different areas of Kiev. However, there are some parts of the city that don't have any places for sports at all. I believe that all children should be involved in some sport activities, as it can help them to maintain a strong character and healthy habits. There should be more  soccer stadiums in areas near the public shools, which most of the children attend. Soccer is the most popular sport in Ukraine, and the majority of people enjoy not only watching, but also playing it. Many parents would be very glad to have their children learn how to play the sport that everyone in the country loves.Another important reason to build more facilities for recreational activities is that the youth has nowhere to go to during the free time after school. Young people prefer to either stay at home or just walk around the streets, spend a lot of money on restaurants, or even clubs. If there were more places to go to, have fun, and develop different skills, the youth would go and spend time there. I strongly believe that there should be more places like that in order for the youth to be healthy and educated. Finally, having many places to do sports or recreational activities helps families to spend more time together and maintain trustful and friendly relationship. It is also a good way for the city to enter a higher level of prestige. As one can see, building new facilities for sports and recreation can help the city in many useful ways.",4.45F15 LATs,87676,"My family            My family is the most special because we are five and I love them. They are so special persons,they are 3 litle children and my wife.

She is  a nice wife that all the time she is preocupate for us. Alonso is 5 years old. He is an extrovertive child, is so cleaver and obedient. Yazid is 3 years old. She is a princess.

Always the family could be the most important in the life of people.","Excercises in the street          The people that do exercises live more and they have a healthy life. Ones of the most importat improvement in my city was the installation of excersices machines in many places, for example, in the street or parks. This idea changed the life of a lot of people in the city for many different reasons.           First, this idea to change the mind of the people. A lot of people think that the excersices was for rich people, but now the people think different. This idea was accepted very well in the comunity. This machines now is to being use for all the people, expecially my same age, 38 years old. The machines exercises are contributing to that all people all different ages can be more healthies.           Second, in a long term this machines help that the people can be more healthy. It is very important to do sports. The people should to do sports two and three times a week. For example, people cannot do sport generally have more helthy problems, they to visit more the doctors. In contrast, the people that to do sport have less healthy problems.           In addition, the idea about to install exercises machines in the street or parks decrease the people that visit the hospital. More people can have a lot of benefit about this. For example, completely families go to the park where they machine was intalled. Oldest,adults, youngest, and child go to the parks to do excersices. Also, where more pople to do sports helping others.          In conclution, sport is the best way for the people. Reduce a lot of indices, for example, crimes, drug consum because the people think in other thing as sports. This experiences was replyed in other citys with a excellent result. My city is very different now. It is very explendid to see a lot of people doing exercises in the street, in the park, in a lot of places.",4.45W17 LATs,98101,"The people who I lived and I live with now are very friendly. I am a lucky person because I always lived with someone that I knew it before. The roommates whom I have now are always willing to help me with my English, and when I need a favor they are always willing to it for me. I live with 5 more people. It is crazy because we have a lot of trash, pans, food, and we do not have so much space in our apartment. 2 of my roommates are Brazilians, the other 2 are american and there is a girl who is from Colombia. We Brazilians do not talk so much with the Americans because of the culture be so different. Also, because they did not serve on a mission yet, it is hard to have a good and nice relationship with, but we still being their friends when they need. Our schedules are different and each one of us is at home in a random time of the day and the week. Also, 3 of my roommates are already at BYU or UVU and they work really hard each week. There was a day when my roommate did not come back to home before 4 in the morning because she was at the Library studying with some friends for the test of the next day. Give this, I was always lucky to live with people that are friendly and always want to help me with my needs, and also, know that they study really hard every day make be a better person, and take my studies serious.","I would improve the public transportation in my city. People from outside of our city, and the citizens they ask for and this is something that they need to improve, the public transportation. In Brazil, our taxes are one of the highest in all the Latina America, and there are a lot of families who prefer have some food at home than spend their money in cars or motocycles. Given this, citizens in my city have to use public transportation a lot because of the taxes; there are not another way to go to work, not even train or subway; and buses are always too full in certain times of the day.First of all, one of the problems in Brazil is the taxes. Our government ask for high taxes for small or medium companies and the big ones normally have lower taxes. If we think about what they are doing it is terrible because they are taking money from people that do not receive high weight and they are ask to pay more taxes. For this reason, my city have more and more people using public transportation because it is hard to keep some money with high taxes.  Also, pay taxes it is important for the improvement of the city, but they normally use this money with unnecessary things like paint streets, or bus stops.Second, when employees are starting to work, most of the time they need to use public transportation to go to work. It is very rough sometimes because when you need or have to get out of the bus and there is a bunch of people between you and the door it is a streeful day. Some people smell really bad in the morning, I do not know why they do not take shower or clean themselves because when you get in on a bus it is impossible not to smell such odor. Also, my city do not have train or subway yet, so people need to use buses most of the time.Third, my city still planning to build a subway to make our lives better. However, they do not strat all the process yet, so we basically need to wait for it. Until there we use our friends ride, or buses to get to work, and there are some times of the day which the buses are completely full of people, and they smell really bad. So, when we need to take the bus it is a sacrifice to go in, but not as India or africans buses are. There is one thing which I just cannot understand which is that we do have a bunch of buses, and there stopped or parked. For me thi do not make any sense. Many people need buses to get to their work or even to come back, and they still need to wait for at least 20 minutes or an hour until the next bus passes by.In conclusion, if I could improve something in my city I would opine about the public transportation because it is a bad quality, and many people need to use it.  Some of the reasons that I chose this topic was to talk about three important points: citizens in my city have to use public transportation a lot because of the taxes; there are not another way to go to work, not even train or subway; and buses are always too full in certain times of the day.",4.46W17 LATs,40123,"My life now is diferent like it was five yeras ago.

There are important companies like Nissan, Jatco, and Yorozu in this city that are looking for young people.

Also, the goverment in Aguascalientes have more facilities for those companies that are helping  young people with job.

This program help a person how has a great idea. The program help you with all the things that you need to start.

This could be because of the high cost of education, or maybe because of the lack of motivation they have. But in fact, the younth in Mexico does not see education as asomething that matter. For this reason, low-cost education for young people would improve the society this country.First, low-cost education allows young people that want to study, to improve their lifes. If  people do not see pay for tuition as someting impossible , they  would not feel descourage and they would study. This would make the younth more able to reach their goals and to reach success in life.Second, people that have education are more productive that those who do not have it. If people have the oportunity to study, they can develop more skills that will improve whichever type of industry. This improvement in the producction of good  become an improvement in economy. As a result people improve the ecomomy of their county and their quality of life.Finally,  people that have access to education improve not only their skills, but also improve the way they solve problems and their minds are more open to new ideas. If more people in Mexico have the opportunity to study, people would have higer standars and more moral rules. The knowledge that people adquire on schools is not just to work, it is also to opend their minds and impprove society.  Education is a key for society, for that reason make education less expensive would allows people to improve their knowledge, the economy where they live, and the society where thir families will grow up.",4.46W17 LATs,66211,"Since April, 2016, I have lived with six people, always in the same apartment.

This issue is not just related with adult people, if not the youth is facing struggles because of the alcohol. In consequense, the focus of this young has been changing to superficial things. For instance, one of the rules that I would like to change is that autorities prohibit and control the consume of alcohol to people who is not 21 years old at least. There are many reasons to support why that norm could make a beneficial idea.First, one of the biggest distraction of the youth is the consume of alcohol. To illustrate, in Santa Cruz is not legal. However, drinks with alcohol are available in any store such as supermarkets, any grocery stores and son on. And the selling of these are not regulated for anyone. In other words, one child younger of 15 years old can buy one of these drings.  The consequense can be horrific. The education has been left behind because young people preffer to buy these drinks and gatter with people of the same age to have fun, instead of focus in their studies. Second, the alcohol brings addictions. Experts have confirmated that the consume of alcohol can bring addition of it. Can be in a near future or in long future. The components of alcohol are to create false feelings to the consumer. Those feelings can be destructive for those young people who are passing throug hard times, because the easiest support is in the alcohol drinks, making them feel worst after the alcohol effects. Those addictions that they can adquire have a huge damage in their lives. For that reason, the control to the seeling of these mus be extremelly prohibited.The last reason, but not less important is the fact that the alcohol drinks do not contain anything productive for the human body. In the contrary, alcohol drinks have tons of useless componets. The damage of alcohol in the human body is terrible, specially when is consume of young people who are in growth stage. Experts declarared that the things that one young individual had consumed in his growth stage will be refleted when whe turn to any older stage. For that reason, the youth does not have to consume any kind of drinks with alcohol, because of the dangerous consequences that it can has in their future related wi",4.47W17 LATs,20410,"I lived with my family in Parck City two years ago.

Young people would benefit to have a better environment in big cities. Some people might think that a city is to laud to have peace or confort. However, cities show that there are a lot variarity and these cities offering more sources to improve education, work experience, and other characteristics from a city. Youth would benefit improving their education. There are more schools that a young person can decide to go to be graduate with a Associate's Degree or with a Bachelor's Degree. There are different schools with different programs or majors . For example, Juan moved from his little town in the jungle to the capital from his country in Brazil. Juan has now a better options to study and through his life style, he is gain more experiences knowing more people, culture, customs, environment. All these knwoledge is helping him to be more wise taking his decisions. The other benefit is that young people can have a better work experience. Work experience help anyone to build a better future. Cities have the advantage to offer diferent type of jobs and diferent pay check. Cities have more options to develop goals and make dreams reality than small cities or small towns. For example, following the story of Juan, when he moved to the city from his town, he found a good job in a market place, selling products online. Juans got more experience ussing computers and Internet. Moreover, Juan learned how to manage his time between school and his job. This city offered him more opportunities since he came out from his small town.

Sometimes in a university city is so complicated find a shuttle to can go to the university because of it is almost all the time full, uncomfortable or crowded. A good improvement that would make your city a better place to live to adult yougs people is to have more shuttles and public transportation like these.      Firts, some many people is studying in the same university, so a lot of students have kind of the same schedule. this make more complicated trying to find a spot in a bus or something.Today many aparments have a shuttle in ther instalations, but is like just a bus for building, so is not enough for all the students, so maybe the goverment can make a law where can be necessary that every building has more than one shuttle for building.     Second, almost all the time the universitaries are so busy to make a luch for  themselves, so that make them be late sometimes, and they can lost an shuttle, but is the goverment can make another rule, a perfect one can be that all the bus stations or public transportation should have an university schedule and they can pass over there in every normal schedule. with this law more students are not going to lost their buss and they will have more posibilities to get to the university on time.       Third, every city has almost a train station. Why we cannot have more than one? if the goverment can make a law to decide at least have three train station, almost all the student are going to have a good way to go to their universities. Also, it can make to improve the economic situation of that city because of more students will decide to take more public tranportation because is pretty cheaper, easy and convinient that buy a car.       In conclusion, do not have a free way, shuttle or public transportation can make you mad and almost all the time, so that is why a good improvement can be make so many new rules ablut transportation like that all the complex aparments can have more than one shuttle, the buss transportation can have a university schedule and the goverment can build more than three train station to improve the economy and the public transportation.",4.48W17 LATs,69540,"In my country I lived with my family that is composed of my father, my mother, and my sister.

These sisters, Hannah and Delaney, are Polynesian, they are very nice and very messy, they lived their dishes everywhere and didn't wash them.

Furthermore, my country is an island, it is very small. People there like to do fishing, surfing, singing, dancing, or just be on town with friends. However, teenagers and young adults don't really have place to have fun. In Tahiti we have like little attractions but most of them are for children. I think that an improvement that would make my city a better place to live is to have a attraction park.First, create an attraction park will permite people of my age to have fun. Many of them don't know what they can do of their journey. They have two choices: first, go back to their home where, in most of cases, their parents drink and hit their children; and the other solution is to stay sit next to the road with friends and smoke, drink or thing like that. Most of them prefer to be outside with their friends, but they are still nothing to do, so, they do things that is illegal, such as make tags or fight with other people. Have an attraction park can permite them to always have to do something. In addition, it will create good place to go with their boyfriend or girlfriend. Second, it will change from little attraction that we had since many years. People are bore of them, they tried to go with friend but all, or most, of the attractions are for children. I remember that don't have an attraction park missed me a lot when I was in Tahiti. Also, it wasn't just me, my sister, our friends, and other person in our Middle and High School had the same feelings. Because of travels, we were able to know what is an attraction park such as in France or United States or New Zealand. Attraction parks make people happy, they forget their problems and it is just like if they entered in a new world.To conclude, I think that create an attraction park in my country can be an improvement that would make my city a better place to live for all kind of people. It will create jobs, and also a place to relax, play and enjoy with friends or family. People need to take some rest, they can't work witout break or they will be depressing.

Transportation, Computers and a good place to live in.     There have been a lot of challenges with the transportation due a lot of students doesn't have cars, motorcycles, bicycles or something like that, it would be great idea if the goverment provide them at least a bicycle to each student so they can have the oportunity to go faster wherever they need to go. It would also be better if the students aggre to take care of those bicycles. It would be amazing if the goverment help them with those resources.     I have met many students who do not have computers to do their homework and they need to go to stores to rent computers, they spend money, time and almost always it is tired. That's why I have tought that woulg be great if the goverment make an idea to help them to provide students access to a computer without spend money and waste a lot of time. For example the goverment could create a computer center where each student can have access with their ID student, and in this way students would have a easier life.    Another challenge that I have seen is the students housing. A lot of students do not live in a good place, many students live with strangers due it is cheaper for the students because the landlords ask less money than others and sometimes it is complicate because it is difficult for them to do not have problems with their landlords. Many students need to walk a long time due where they live is far away from their school. It would be a spectacular idea if the goverment or somebody else start a construction close to the university which have enough buildings so each student can live in.       I think doing those things the comunnity will love more to the goverment.

Some of that ideas to find my city a good place to live are: first, implement security cameras, and second more police man on streets.           First of all, implement security cameras is a good way to increase the incontrol about the city. People who do not rule their lives by high standars usually think they can do whatever they want in  every plance. Offenderst get more confidence in doing bad things against people when they know anyone are seeing them. For many situations like those, security cameras can be a good resource and a good support for the law and for poeple who live in that place. In summary security cameras will support our securty and increase our confidence in the security point.          Second, absoluteluy more police man in streets can be a good security resource against insecurity. usually people who do not have good intentions obtain more confidence to hurt someone or damning others when they do not have a defensor or some help. Police man can bring more security for people who walk in streets and even for those who are driving a car. Of course, it can be a way to stop those who do not have good intentions or are looking for doing bad things. In conclusion more police man in the street can be a good suport of security in streets for many people.          In conclusion,  implemetn security cameras and more police man on cities can be a good resource to feel save in a big city. If you want to see it in the point of view of people who are looking for a good place to live it is a good option. But if we look at it and at the same time looking at the future, a city with this special features can increas on incomes and in the turist space. It can be a good suppor in some years not just for a city it can be a great support also for a country.",4.51F15 LATs,99258,"Right now i am lviving with a Venezuelan girl. She has been my roomate since I came to the United States, and we became best friends. She has dark hair  and skin. Also, she is short but has a well proportionated body. We are opposite physically and also in our personality, but we complete each other which makes our relationship very strong. My roomate really enjoys to dance. It is one of her favorite things to do on weekends. Although she hates working, she worked most of the year. Currently, she is not working, so she is happy about it. I love to live with her because she is very funny and entertaining. She raises me up when I am down. Music is always playing in our apartment, and of course it is mostly latin music. Also, she has a really good taste in food and we usually cook together. I am very grateful to have met her here.","My country due to its small size does not have many universities. Some are Public and others are private. Public universities are free, and private universities are not as expensive as universities in the United States. However, students are not very encouraged to attend university, and it is univerities responsability to change that. This essay will state some of the problems to Uruguay's universities. First, they are all located in the same area. Students all around the city have to travel to the center of the city to go to shcool. Although Montevideo is not a big city, sometimes this journey takes more than 2 hours due to the traffic because everyone is headed to the same place. If universities could have more scattered centers around the city, the traffic would not be so stuck and students would not have to travell for so long. Second, public and private universities do not offer the same majors. Due to the economy in Uruguay, public universities cannot afford to offer some of the most expensive majors. Therefore, students have to change their majors or go to a private university.  For instance, those students that want to study graphic design cannot do it in a public university, so they have to go to a private one and pay significant amounts of money. Third, universities do not have many extra curricular activities. As mentioned before, Uruguay's univerities do not have enough money to build soccer fields, indoor pools, or to form teams of any kind of sport. Consequently, students who are interested in playing  sports have to attend a normal gym that could be really expensive. This is discouraging for students especially because excersising is becoming more and more important in the country's culture. To conclude, Uruguay has many problems with it's universities. They are not located in a convenient way for students. Also, public and private universities do not offer the same majors which is unfair for students. Finally, universties do not have sports teams. If all these aspects could be changed, students would be encouraged to go to school, and they would be happier with what the country has to offer to young people.",4.51S17 Placement,31313,"I lived in Lima Peru with my family.

I love my family.","I used to live in Lima Peru, and there is a place really good to live but as any place it needs some improvements to be a better place to live. In this opportunity I will talk about one improvement, which is about the pollution. Since many years ago, it has been building a lot of fabriques and the movement of cars have increased. So, pollution has been increasing and increasing. Many of people is suffering by the toxic gases that are given by the fabriques and old cars, which many of them are broken. Good industries in specific places tried to fix it, they used different ways to do it but it didn't work at all. So, many people started to moved on but the air was also contaminated. And about cars, many companies which sell cars tried to have good prices to get new cars. So they tried to stop the use of old cars that used to contamined the air but people prefer to be with their old and broken cars. So, it didn't work neither.One of many solutions that law department should make is create a law that all of the fabriques and industries must be far away of the city, and they also have to make another law that can't allow the use of cars which are broken. At the beggining it will be hard because a lot of people love to be inside their cars and if industries and fabriques are located far away, people wouldn't like to go so far away from their homes to their jobs but as I saw in other countries like Dutch, a lot of people prefer to use bike instead cars. So, with many bikes people would preserve the enviroment and decrease the pollution that we have. Also, people will be good healthy. In my opinion, making some changes are hard but if the changes are for a good way to live. We need to adapt ourselves and support those changes. People used to complain about changes because we are always in our confort zone but if we want to improve and have a better style of life, we need to share and be the difference.",4.51W17 LATs,59478,"All of us lives with someone, for example family, roommates, co-workers, etc. Now I am living with my aunt and her husband.

Sometimes, people have to adapt to the place they are living on.However, sometimes something has to be changed for the people's benefit. An improvement that will make my city better for the people of my age is to have more places to have fun for the following two reasons.    First, people with the age of 19 or so are going to be able to have fun. Nowadays, many people are studying at a college, university, or doing couses to build their future. Studying sometimes can be stressful and having a variety of places to have fun will be a good opportunity to relax for a moment. Who does not want, after studying for a long time, have time for himself and take a break doing something fun? For example, a person who attended to his current classes and after that he studied for more than 3 hours, he will be sick of the study and he will want to do something to forget the study for a while. Having a variety of places to have fun such as bowling, dance parties, etc, they will allow him to choose what he wants to do in that moment. People are going to have fun with a variety of places specially for them.    Second, poeple are going to be healthier and not being likely to get ill. Because of studying and work a lot to build the future, perople in the of 19 or so are more likely to get ill in different aspects. Stress, for instance, is the most common illness that people face because of studying and working a lot at the same time. Besides this, having places to have fun will allow them to clean their mind and keep going with their stuff in another moment more relax. Being healthy is important and nobody deserves to do bad in what they do for their benefit in long-term. Not always they are going to be able to take few hours to relax, but having just a little moment in a fun place will make the person stay well and do not increase the stress or worry. People should be healthy and going to fun places they will not be ill.    Having more places to have fun for people of the age will help them to have fun and be healthier. Al of us need to have a moment for ourself, relax and forget for a while all the worries.

Almost all the companies in the country have their main offices in Lima. Therefore, it is always crowded and with heavy traffic. Our transportation system is not working right. To be completely honest, we don't have a transportation system that works at all. In Lima it takes a very long time to get from one place to the other. For this reason, transportation is one biggest improvement that I think would make my city a better place to live for people my age. I would implement a new transportation system to connect the city, reducing the necessity of having so many cars.People my age are usually full-time workers. This means they have to go to their offices every single day. Some of them have field work, which means they have to move around the city a lot. Transportation in Lima is so complicated that it can take you half an hour to get from one district to the other, even if you are going 10 blocks away. It is very complicated to drive in the traffic of Lima. Walking is sometimes faster, but some distances are so far apart that walking is not an option. Riding a bike should be a good option, however, peruvian drivers do not respect the rules, so it is very dangerous to ride a bike in Lima. Therefore, I would implement a new transportation system with a network of metro, trains and buses that will connect the city. This will allow people to movilize from one place to another and reduce traffic because less people will require to drive their own cars to get where they need to go. They will be able to take the train, bus or metro and they wouldn't have the concern of having to think about where to park. An underground transportation system could release the amount of traffic in the city and since that costs less than paying for car loans, gas, oil, and any other things cars need. It may also help people save some money. Another benefit of developing a new transportation system is that the city's pollution could be reduced drastically. Nowadays, Lima is known for its grey sky without stars. You can never see stars in Lima, not even during a blackout. The air is so polluted that Lima has the highest amount of people with breathing problems like asthma. There are some days when you cannot look more than 10 blocks aways, because the air is so dense that it does not allow you to look further. Developing a transportation system, specially if it includes metro, trains, and buses, will decrease the need of having to own a car to be able to movilize where you need to go. Which means that less cars will be driven around the city. Diminishing the amount of cars being driven affects directly the environment and reduces the amount of smog in the air. Probably, in a short term, the changes wouldn't see as significant. However, in the long term, the city could have a clear air, and a better quality of life for it citizens. Since the world is being more and more polluted every time, taking care of our air could make a significant difference in the long term. All in all, developing a new and solid transportation system that is integrated and precise, could help reduce traffic and pollution in Lima. This will reduce the amount of time spended going from one place to the other, and at the same time will dimish the contamination of the city allowing its citizens to have a better air quality.",4.52F15 LATs,26380,"My roommates are very different from me. I wanna start describing to Heidi. She is my principal roomate, we sleep togheter in the same room. She is sometimes very rare, but at the same time is very kind. I know that she have bad days, but still always try to be nice with me, and besides that, I try to help her too. Another roommate that I have in this moment is Brooklyn. Her physicall is that she is a very big woman, to be more precisely, very tall and a little fat.

One change that young people could be very benefitial is a took time to go home. Even a lot of people are in disagree with that, and they want more liberty because they use a justification that they are young, this could be a change that can be more healthy and preventive for all. One of the reasons, and benefit for a immediate term is prevent deads by car crash, and a long- term have more lowest levels of young peolple with addictions.The benefit in a short term is deads for car crash. Car crahs it has one of the highest levels of reasons for the use of addictive substances, principal drink alcohol. A lot of young people are diying for being imprudent with the use of alcohol. They do not think wisely the results of the abuse of this, and the bad decision of drive in this conditions. For example, I have a lot of people around me in my country, that they made this kind of actions, even they still do not have died, they were very close to have a one car cras. People should have a a took time for being home, and prevent this kind of bad actions and decisions outside from home. The purpose to have this rule, it could help to prevent this kind of situations.The second benefit in a long term, is that young people in my country it could stop to have this kind of addictions because the parties, and nightmare places like clubs, they would close more early. The abuse of addictive substances , like alcohol, is one of the reason why people in does not have a brilliant future in their jobs, or even worst, in their families. When in a city, the poblation has a tooken time for being home, it could help for prevent parties, or meetings that promove the drink of alcohol. For example, in my country, this rule does not exist, and that is why a lot of clubs works with schedules until 6 am. This kind of places does not have a control of alcohol drinks, and even 'better' for the young people, they can drink everything they want. This rule could be something preventive for the abuse of addictive substances, more control for the young people. In a short term, preventing car crash, and a long term, preventing more young people with a lot of addictions in the future, this rule it could be a very useful help for all the brilliant future of these people. Maybe it could be a big change for my home city, even some people could think it could be impossible, but the results can be unimaginable. If the government put this rule, the young people could be more focus on their studies, a lot of parents could stop to have worries about their sons, what are they doing on nights outside. Also, if this rule work it, the benefits it could be more far than preven car crash, they could have a better future. Government should put the eyes in a rule like this, for the benefit of the future country, at the end, the young people are the future government, leaders, and etc.",4.53F15 LATs,31604,"People who are around you can make a really big difference in your life.

The government of the city is trying to find the solution to this problem, but so far the situation did not improve. One of the things  can make a differnce is to provide more opportunities to ride bicycle.  For that the city has to make sure that there are bicycle lanes on the roads.  By providing bicycle lanes the number of issues will be solved such as: traffic and safety on the road.     Many cities use bycicle lanes to reduce the traffic.  In europe a lot of people ride bikes because it is easier to get around then on a car. Each road has a bicycle lane that provides opportunities for people to ride bikes and not to use cars. This stategy is so effective that many other cities in the world start using this method.  Cities like New York invite their ctitzens to ride bikes during the summer in order to reduce the traffic. In order to provide that option major streets of new york were recostructed and bicycle lanes were added to the streets.    Another problem that bycle lanes solve is safety. It prevents accidents and insures safety of the bicyclists. Also people feel more confident to ride bicycles when they have additional lane for them. Being confident provides less stress and as a result bicyclists make less mistakes on the roas wich leads to less accidents.    I think people in my City underestimate the difference that bicycle lanes can make. It will reduce the traffic and will provide safety for people who ride bicycles. People of my age would really appreciate opportunity to use bicylce more in every day life.  Providing additional lanes would make it safer and attract more people to this activity and as a result will decrease traffic.",4.53F15 LATs,84254,"Living in Orem is very easy, I love to live close to the mall.

Mexico has a big diversity culture, it has different kind of food, and it has many places to visit for vacations. There are three things that Mexico can improve for to be a better place to live. Investing, studiying, and buying new things are not easy for people who live in this country, but if the Goverment works together with the police, it will make a big and good difference.     First, investing in business is good for people who wants to make a good profit, but the secury system does not help a lot. People are afraid to be rober while they are making good profit. For example, five years ago one of my family's close friend was kidnaping while he was working in his own company. If the police will notice all the problems that murders or rober are planing or doing now, the police probably stop any incident of this problem.     Second, studying in Mexio is a good place to learn any career. In Mexico there are good opportunities for most of the people, but the security is not good enough. For example, when I was studiying my degree, I used to take the bus every Friday because my dad could not pick me up. One day, after school a man stop me, and he asked me for money. I left all my money to him, and I was scare. So, most of the students who do not have their own car can have this problem.     Third, buying new things or luxury things in Mexico is not good at all. Mexican people like to spend money in clothes, cars, houses, and vacations. People from Mexico do not feel savety spending money because robers or murders think that those people have a lot of money. Nowadays, mexican people are afraid about that     In conclusion, the police in Mexico is not good enoug. The goverment from Mexico need to fix many things in this country. Mexican people do not feel confortable investing, studying, and buying new things because they are afraid. Also, mexican do not feel confident to ask for help to the police because most of the time police officers do not help at all. Finally, police from Mexico are not well prepare to protect people because they need to receive a big training.",4.53S17 Placement,35054,"I lived with 5 firends in my past 3 years. two of them are made me impressed.We are best firends with same age,  and worked in same company with an sales representive, one is named Vivi, she is a Chinese gril, with long black hair, very slim and taller than me.

Besides, I hope everybody can make selfcontrol of dirty stuffs on the road, this will make benefit to everybody and for our whole city. Further more, I suggest that, people in my age can orginaze the activities, like gather unused things from each family and encourage each family to do the same thing.Second, considring long-term offect, my opinon is, the pullution exits for many years, no matter air pollution or water pollution, the orginal reason is lack of control, so I hope goverment can pay attention on this and take stratagies. Tell people how important it is to our city and to all members of this city. I remember one of my relative get cancer bcs of the water. there is more and more people to get cancer with very high rates. So I'm eager to see the improvents of our city, like less pollution. Each miner factory should take the right way to make pollution, all of them should take different ways as their situation, this need the goverment help.No matter which way to change the current enviroment of our city, I hope all members of our city will realize the importance between enviroment and each memebers.

Many people say that it is very useful to have a rest every one work hour. The problem of many cities is that there is no entartaiment places where everyone can have a rset and spend a time with friends. Moreover, every city need ro have a kind of mall where people will have oportunity to eat something, play some games with friends, and study. Game mall wil be a good improvement for a city because it will be a place that is in the downtown, it will be a center of all touristic events, and it will be very cheap.       First, mall will take place in the down town, in the very center of the city, so it will be very easy for everyone to get there. It is very important for people, espesially for students, to get there. Additionally, there will be a special paplic transport that will be connected with all parts of the city and with a downtown.  It will be a big advantage for the students, who have no car. For example, it will be very exiting for a groop of people to go to the place where thay can relax after classes. Moreover, is it very good that they have not to thing about how to get there because of a special transport. By the way, students will have a discount for that kind of transport while they are studying good.       Second very important thing for every city is tourism. It brings a big sum of money every year, so government have to keem enough attention for this question. Game mall will have several rooms where each tourist will lern about a history of that city and the country at all. Moreover, there will be an option to choose a language that foreigner is speaking, so he will be surely interested in that.       Last advantage of Game mall are prices. It is expected that there will be many people every day, so government and the main manager have to make this place not very expensive. However, it will be cheaper for citizens, so foreigners will have to pay more. Additionally, there will be specific sales every month. For example, there will be discounts for students who have good grades, or holidays sales.        In conclusion, Game mall is an answer for the question 'How to combine an entertainmant place, and a tourist center, in one place, that will be cheap and afordable for everyone?' Also, it will have long term consequence of the improvement.",4.55W17 LATs,35094,"When I served on my mission, I lived with three American sisters. That was my first time to live with foreigners. The experience was interesting. Since we were from different culture backgrounds, sometimes it was easy to have misunderstanding. It took a while for us to adjust ourselves to be used to each other. One of the American sisters was the cutiest one. She is really easy going and likes to try new things. One time when she saw I was eating chinese spicy noodles with chopsticks, she wanted to try as well. So, she took half an hour on using chopsticks to eat little spicy noodles.It was almost time for us to go,but she still had a lot left, I asked her to use fork,but she said 'I need to use chinese to eat chinese noodles'. She made me laugh so hard. I love being around people who like chinese culture and trying new things.","People around my age in my city are busy with making money.It is good that when people work hard for their lives.However,when people do not know how to control the balance between life and work,they will get into 'trouble' easily,which means they will get a lot of pressure. It can be good when the stress transfer to motivation when we know how to manage our emotion.Nevertheless, people today only focus on how to make money faster and easier , so sometimes they forget about how to love themselves.Personally, I think that government or companies can help them. First thing they can do is to build up a system for helpng people record their emotion situation.Through this system, people can see how work influence their emotion.It can be a warning to them when they are sressful with their work, so they can take some actions to fix the problems.Also, the companies can adjust  their work when the system shows the person is struggling with the work.Second, in the city, the government can build more clubs which are for people to relief their stress.In these kind of clubs, people can talk to people who are professional in phychocoly area, they also can have some healthy social life there.I think these two ways temporarily can make people realize it is important to pay attention to their mentally health and in the long-term consequences, it is good to help them have  healthy lives.Both the government or companies and people themselves have to take that responsibilities to balance people's lives and work.",4.55F15 LATs,79379,"I have been living with my aunt and uncle here in America for several months.  They are very different from my parents, and this has been difficult and excited to me  because I have to adapted to them. First of all, they are very stricted and I can't hang out with my friends whenever that I want. I know that's not a good quality because with my parents, they trusth on me, and with my family here I think they don't. However, being with my family here is more fun than being with my parents. Both, my uncle and aunt, they are very funny. My aunt is short, and she doesn't speak very well English. Because of that is funny when she laughs of her size, and how she speaks with Americans. My uncle is tall, and he is mean with people. I know that's not good, but he naggs my counsins all the time, and it's very funny  how they get mad. On the other hand, my parents they aren't familiar at all. Always they are working, and they never spent time with me. Even though I love them, I would prefer that they become more than my uncle and aunt because I really feel as a family with them. They jobs are very different too.

Here in Provo, young people has many benefits, such as the security and the clean streets. However, one of the things that the Provo goverment should improve is the bus service. Even though provo has bus service, this is not very efficient, and the students can't enjoy it even they need it. If goverment improves this services, the students would benefit in different ways. First, they would spend less money, and they would waste less time.       The improvement of the bus services would benefit students spending less money. First of all, most of the studends have to pay their school, and college is one of the most expensive things. Some students have cars because their rental aparments are far away. This is another bill that they have to pay. However, if the bus services improve, they don't have to buy a car, and spend money in gas. Bus is chipper than pay often gas and security car. Students and young people don't have to be worry about how they will do with the transportation in the city because they know that the bus service is effective and they will spend less money. Even though you have to pay to use the bus service, this it can be chipper and a very good benefit for students and young people.      Second, the students would waste less time. One of the problems that the bus service has is that is very slow. Each bus takes 30 minutos or more to take it. If in provo there are more busses to use, the students can use them, and they won't walk or run to classes. Most of the college are huge, and most of the students don't have a car, so they have to walk to classes. However, students don't use the bus service because it's very slow. If the bus service was effecient, students can use them, and even study in the bus. With a good bus service, people who live far away from college, they will be able to have more time to study. For example, I live far aways, and it's very stressful to think that I have to wait for a bus for 30 minutes. The improment of this service will help students to have more time.   In conclusion, a good bus service wil help young people to spend less money and to waste less time. Most of the young people are students, and students are very stressful and busy with college. With a good bus service the good consequences are many. Young people from other cities will come to Provo because they know that they don't have to worry about transportation. They will spend less money and time. If the bus service improved, they benefit for students are many.",4.55W17 LATs,75564,"I will never forget my homestay.When I was 15 I came to US  with my brother.We had lived in a big homestay,This homestay is my aunt's friends.    Homestay's family were preety good and freidndly.Everyday we ate meals togther,and also the family took us to so many beatuiful place I was very excited.One of the family member I really like the mother,she was preety kindly and freidnly ,She cooked meals for us and took us went shopping .And also I like the father,Who is most powerful person in the faimly,but he also very kind and good.He got so many games and took us to ther park or somewhere for fun. me and my brother were happy.    I still rember the faimy and they take me so many fun.I love them and will miss them.","Make young apartment is good for people for some reasons.In the city has so many young people,  they are find jobs or work on  some companies,but there are some problems, young people going to buy a house is too expensive because they donn't have to much money.So goverment should give young people good apartment for reduce their stress.     Firstly,  Most of Young people don't have too much money to buy a house and also they are left home came to the city  for work.Im my oponions,I think govermoent should proived apartment to young people.Goverment just reicved some money, This can make young people more comfortable and can save money for family or buy new house.    Secondly, So many young people live togther can make people make new friends and get married. Now so many young people are couch potaot,This is not good for youth.If they are live togther,they can talk each other and make new friends or hang out.This is good for young people and also good their parents. For example,My brother is a video games stand,He always at home playing his games,his mother was so worried about him,so they are deicded let my brother left home and find a new place by own.He was left home and find a apartment with some guys.This make him not intersted games and not a couch potato any more.    At last,Goverment provide young apartment can make people more  indpendent,So many young people live with faimly when their old enguh because they just think with parents more convience.They don't worried anything and more lazy.this is not good for young people.So if goverment provide can make parents let childs go a new place and let kids learn how to live by own.    For these reasons,goverment provied young apartment have so has so many benefits.I think every city's goverment should do this.Let young peolpe more indpendent and working hard for our city.",4.56F15 LATs,87928,"As a international students, living with the roommates that I don not know is normally. Sure, this is very different with live in my hometown. And I want to describe in three different ways. Such as interests, schedules, and personalities. First, my roomate loves to cook. She can spend her time in the kitchen more than three hours per day. However, I think it is a benefit for me. It is because I can eat much of good dish everyday. Second, she is not a student. And her working schedule is from 9:00p.m. to 7:00a.m. It caused some problems. It is because she worked at home. Therefore, when she worked, she made some noise and made me hard to sleep. Third, she is a talkable person. She love to talk when she feel bored. However, I am a quiet person. I don not want to talk too much. In fact, I want more praivte roome. In conclusion, when people live together, we need more conversation and understnad with each other.","Nowadays in my city, Hong Kong. It is facing some kind of big problems for the people, who is in my age. The people live in Hong Kong have a lot of stress. Living in Hong Kong is harder than other city as I know.  For my view, I think the there are three way that my city could be change. Such as educational, housing, and health problem.      First, I think the education is one of the important way to make our life better. However, people in my city are difficult to take the highly education.  In fact, there are only eight university in my city. That are not enough to satificed all the students, who tried to apply the university. Furthermore, the tutions in my city is experience. Most students can't afford the cost of the education. Otherwise, students have to loan for pay their tutions. When students finish their education, they may use ten to fifteen years to pay their loan from government.    Second, people in my age are almost ready to get marry. In my city, people live in a very small area. Mostly, they have to live with their family. If they get marry, then they must to leave their family. However, the housing is expensive in my city. I read a news last month. It mentioned that if a couple want to buy their own house. Their parents have to pay the thirty present deposit. Afterward, that couple have to spend more than twenty-five years to pay the rest of their house. And one of the condition is they must have health body and have a job in the future twenty-five years.   Third, health is important for everyone. It is because people in Hong Kong have ton of stress, it caused some health problems themselves. For my experience, when I worked in Hong Kong. Normally, I worked from 9:00a.m. to 6:00p.m. However, it is improssible. I needed to work overtime from Monday to Friday. The companies in my city that do not care about your life. They requested you work even you leave from office. Mostly, my manager would call me at 11:00p.m. after my working time. It made me felt stress. It is because I cannot leave my cell phone, email, and computer. If I miss one call, it would cause me a big problem.   In conclusion, the people that live in my city in my age, they cannot live for their wish. They live for money, house, and job. Also, they cannot achieve the 'work life balance.' I love my city, but these problems make the people and place worse. If someday, the people in my city can take the education easier, they can afford their own house with their family, or people can live healther than now. I believe that could be a better place.",4.56S17 Placement,11195,"I used to live with my younger sister, her name is Dulce. She is 25 years old, she is shorter than me, she has long black hair, and she is always in a very good mood no matter what. Tipically, she gets up very early in the morning, prepare her self for a long day at work and she takes a bus to get to the bulding of the Company she works at. Probably, what I like the most of living with her, is that she is very optimistic, she always sees the bright side of any situation, which I think helps her to develop a good relationship with people at work, or any group that she belongs to.","Mexico City is a very polluted city, however, it would be a better place to live in if the people living there were more concious regarding three main points that would help to improve the air quality in the city, such as car pooling, recycling trash, and placing the trash in the designated places.Many people drive alone to their jobs, wich cause many cars, taking a few people to the same place. What I propose is to car pooling as much as it is possible, if a group of collegues share different owner car each day, they will not just save money, but they will help to prevent the rise of pollution in the city, which is a very serious problem. In addition, I think that another way to decrease the pollution in the city, is to make different campaings in order to promote recycling as a common practice for people living there. For example, when I was in elementary school, we had a project to separate plastics and paper at home and also at school; at the begining it was hard to do so, because we were not used to that, however, the more we did it the easier it became. So, it probably will take time to see the benefits, but for sure they will appear.Moreover, I have noticed that many people are used to leave the trash in the street and not in the designated places. So, I propose to make bigger places for the trash which allows people to throw wastes in the right place. Finally, I think that if people are better educated to improve air quality, that would help to make Mexico City a better place to live in.",4.56W17 LATs,66187,"the family with i live now is one familiy i meet her in Provo, utha, they live in payson are they are amazing people. how i meet them ?. that story start, when i meet his son in bolivia, and he seve a mission there in Bolivia, Santa cruz and I meet her like companion, and he say me that I can visit her family when I want, the family i meet is increible, the father name is Byan, he work in ADove and he is the person who do the marketing, the mother name is eliz, she is a teacher for kids ,see is really sweat person, the older brother name is hayden and he work in JJpen is one place where you can fix your car and stuff and the last is my friend, his name is Roy and he studied in UVU and work in one callcenter and that is the family I live now that people are  very important for me for the reason they give me a house and one place to state and the opportunity to be here. they are the most humble people I meet every day I learn a lot of that family and I considered like a family for me because they make me feel like a part of the family and they are always are kind with me so that is amazing and that is the family with I live.","the Big city always say that give a lot of opportunity or are more advanced than other or have better education.that what the younger people want to found for build a great future and that only the city can give  for the youngers. For the reason how my city can to change for us the younger and became a big city? the city we can imitated Like new york, the city of dream or the other city like spain but wht s the idea they have make amaing. For that following reason, they have more opportunity for work because they economy is geart for make a lot of money, the education is the high level and that make the people can thing more clear and make a lot of thing. the city have more diversity more improve you habilitys and more stuff for do it.Firts, the Economic for people with my age is fundametal and is very important for make a dream come true or be relax about our future, For example is you know in the future you wil have a great job and make money tha encourage you to study more harder and make more for your study and that make the people became more intelligent in think more better and you can study more or have more vision and don't have fair for make your dream. That what make is the economic change, because ni see the people of my age afair to do something because they don't now if they can make and see the economic of my country and they start to make a desicion like the poor people domn't have enought for study start to say is much better if i start to work and don't study so that is a problem. in conclusion that is the economy change in my country more peolpe of my age make a good desicion.Second, the city change a lot if have more education so for that we need more university or schoold with more high education. for the reason the education is the most important and the education make a one country great. why ? because the people are more intelligen and start to thinking more clear wbout a lor of stuff and they make more invation for his country make great so that the younger need. the Education i a value very important give the people more opportuniy for job and the live and if the city have more high education the people of my age can change a lot of manner of thinking and we don't have more thief and more person are bad. for that reason they have start to make more univerity are free or cheaper for give that opportunity to people dont have enougth money for pay. In conclusion the education can change a lot and that is a good benefit for people of my age and for my city too.Last, The diversty is good for the youngers people that give the people thinking more and don't think only in a few thing. For example If my city have that kind of diversity of job like in europe or EEUU,like musian or painter that kind of job don't pay a lot in my country and they are younger are very talend and that can change a lot fot younger can improve his skill and don't need to go another place for develop his habillty and have more opportunity that is word, opportunity that the younger people like to listen . that why if we have more diverstiy of job or education can change a lot in my country and give more opportunity for other.In conclusion, my city could change a lot for our benefif of people with my age with that reason.more opportunity for study , the economi have to change and the diverty of jod or university can change a lot because if my city do that is start to change the mind of the younger people and that is very important for the people have my age and can improve a lot of thing is us so for that reason my city",4.57W17 LATs,74194,"I came to the United States four months ago.

It is a country in eastern Europe, people that have visited really want to go back and visit it. Although there are cities that need to improve they tourism. A city called Peja, is very beautiful and peacful, but there is somthing that is missing right now, mountains need to be protected and the lake needs to be clean so the fish would come back. The city I live in is very unique. It is sourrended from magnificient and beautiful mountains from the north and a marvelous lake on the east. There are people that like mountains and there are some other people that like the like. It really does not matter. What it matters is that, wherever they go they mantein the environment clean, and they do not make damege to the plants. As long as they will try to keep the environment clean that will help everyone enjoy their trip, rather lake or the mountains. The people sometimes do not consider, the importance of plants in Rugova Mountains, what they care is to go up to the mountains and cut trees and sell them. Isn't this horrible? Yes, that is something that we try to improve in my country, we want people to know that they can not just go into the woods and cut the trees. They should understand, that what damage can cause to the environment. If people in my country improve they behavior and do not throw trash around the streets would be very helpful. The waste that those people throw is leaking into the lake. The chemical bottles or whatever they throw away, is causing a very detreminal to the fish or any other creator that lives in that lake, and people do not consider that as a potential to stop doing that. If everyone would just make a donation, and allocate the money , we would have a deep clean to the lake and we would save the fish that are everyday diseperaing. Sometimes, it does not take to much effort, it just takes a little bit of time and think that how can I improve and be an example for other people. If we clean the lake, it will be helpful for everyone and more people would want to go over there and visit it more often, the tourism would increas if we just do little changes.Even if it takes time to recover, I believe that it will be worthy. When we just think, that mother nature will be greatful for any of us that contributes a little by little, by cleaning or just not throwing waste materials is amazing. It is individual, everyone should start with themselves, stopping themselves doing damage to the nature. If people start doing that now I know it will be helpful, it will help the tourism grow each day.",4.57W17 LATs,07146,"Seven years ago I lived with my two parents and my five brothers, including me, we are six.

But the trees and even beautiful avenues had been invaded for comercial banners that caus strees because our mind are not able to process a lot of information, the colors of the letters and shape is some confused in most of the cases without a good shape.

In my opinion, among them, especially one improvement that would make my city a better place to live for people my age is building apartments with institutes for fun or self-development around them  in my country. There are some reasons why I think that statement.  First of all, development of apartments solves the problem with homeless and poverty. Many people have the fair opportunities to live better environment. In my county, there is a small land. People who live in my country should have managed their small domain efficiently. Then, lots of apartments are appeared, people do not need to worry about their houses.Second, since many institutes for fun ro self-development are built in my city, many people can manage their time to reinforce their health and enjoy their life. Some researchers said, people have gotten stressed in their lives with working and studing, and so on. However, improvement of these make people reduce their problems with stress thing. Last, as technology such as computers and phones develops, people is losing their communication and intimacy between them. It makes people idolent. However, these institutes get appeared, people can get along with other people. People who are neighbors share their hobbies, talk about their lives. In conclusion,  there are three reasons why I think that one improvement that would make my city a better city to live for people my age. People ought to recognize these purpose of it and use them  in proper ways.

Also, people try to imporve their own style of life to be happy specially if they have the same age that you.  One improvement taht will be better for a country is to improve the environment in a country.Getting other kind of trasportation will help to preserve the environment. One example fot this issue is not using a car and change for a bike. For example, many people with the same age can bike to go to their work, gym, and university because all of the place is close to their live.

However, many people do not care about it that it can be dangerous because the big bussiness produce plastic. The effect to use plastic bag can be controversial and affect for the future of children.

They have different schedules which during the whole day is difficult to see us each other because of different schedules. Also, they have different personalities, one of my roommates show so much love for others doing little things for others such as cooking, helping us witn our homework and advicing us.

Education is an important event that each person should be care about it. Education would be a good improvement where I live for the a few reason learning skills and abilities and getting better jobs.First, according to the educative system education is the best way that students can learn new skills and abilities in order to apply those skills in their lives. As much education people have more people can help their own families and countries to improve, as a result, standards of living will be better. For instance, according to the ranking of education, most of latin countries are  categorized as one of the worst educative system in the world. As a result, people don't get good education and they don't develop good skills and abilities which will help them their families and the country to increase. Nowadays, most of latin countries have many economic problems. Education is important to help people learn skills and abilities because people keep the country up and it is the only way to improve countries and lives.Second, education bring people great opportunities to lead their own lives. One of the opportunities that education bring to people in their lives is throught jobs. Education give the permission to people to get better jobs, jobs are really important because jobs help people make money to help their families, but also help the country to improve. Another is, better jobs help people to get more money which people can get better education in order to achievement their aims. For instance, during the world war II people from the US were starving because people couldn't get job to gain money for their families and people was suffering; however, the government decided to make some projects in order to bring people opportunities to work. After the world, many people thir style of life improve. In consecuence, people could be able to give their children better education, and because of that the life style in US is much better that other countries.In conclusion, education can change the world by doing small things. People just need to do their best trying to learn skills and abilities in order to get in the futute better jobs.",4.59F15 LATs,01307,"I have some intresting roommate now in my appartment.

Although science and technology have become prevade every aspect of people's lives and as a result, society is changing at a speed which is quite unprecedented, some improvements is significant when people attempt to make a city to be a better palce. Creating an efficient media life is a significant improvement when people have a strong desire to benefit the whole society.             On one hand, communitcation has become more and more easy and convenient since smart devices prevade broadly. However, most people like my age do not receive tremendous benefits from smart devices for some reasons. First, most of people my age do not have efficient media lives via utilizing advanced technology. The fact is that a lot of youth spend time and energy on games of low-benefit social communication is obvious such as tender or facebook. I have a profound conclusion that the purpose of tender and facebook need to be altered. An efficient media life is formulated by some positive goals. Therefore, people can create a new thing which not only stimulate youth to center on reading and express their opinions but also focus on interaction among youth to help them overcome their instinc vulnerabilities. As a result, youth won't waste time on excessive social activities, and the whole city will full of virtues.          On the other hand, an efficient media life should be easy to prevade every aspect of youth's lives. Thereby, some specific clubs are necessary to be organized. For example, some activities which can help youth enhance friendship and knowledge are one of good choices to benefit people. Besides, the novel media life could be a stage for everyone when they seek help or provide others with assistance. All in all, the final goal is to reduce boring life and create a positive circumstance to everyone in the city.       It does not surprise youth to discover that new media life can replace their primitive opinions on how to use advanced technology, and this improvement also encourages youth to create a significant life career in future such as cultivating virtues, holding dreams, and stimulating each other.",4.59W17 LATs,88328,"I'm living in an apartment with other three students.

This generation is having lots of problem in today society. There are people that thinks that goverment should do something to remedy this situation, but other thinks that is the generation that need to move one and work hard for themselves. If it is an opportunity that my city would be a better place for young people is to organize schools in all aspects and change the insurence plan for students.       First, one think to be change are the schools building. If my city or better the goverment would have the opportunity to do something is to rebuild the schools. Im my city, there are schools that were buld in ninetenth century, and somehow is dangerous to stay in a class that the roof can barely stay. For example, there where episodes that an earthsquake hit my city most of the school almost were raise down. Hopefully were not a tragedy but this situation would not happen again. Is this that institution or goverment should work on to be a better place for people in my age.

Students that can not effort an insurence that is bouble that the payment of a job that they work part time  they can do nothing. For example, there are students that barely can pay for their books, because those are expensive, how they can affort an insurance. It will be a good improvement if the government could do something to change my city in a good way.

It is even reccommanded that a city or government should work on to fix this problem of young generation, because the consequences are that most of them wants to leave the city just becasue they don't see changes.

For that reasons people begab to move from rural areas and other close places to the city. Traffic congestion is the principal problem in my city but it can solve with the following possible solutions.First, promoting walking and cycling. Waking and cycling can reduce significantly traffic and make people happier and healthier. Using cycles and walk reduce the use of cars and reduce carbon emisiSecond, using public transportation helps to reduce traffic jam. Using public transportation can move a lot of people just in one vehicle and help to reduce the carbon emissions. For instance, you can move around 50 people for one place to another and reduce the number of vehicles on lanes. Finally, using intelligent transportation systems ease traffic congestion. Intelligent transportation systems help commuters to identify which roads are heavy and also help to know the weather conditions that prevent potential accidents. For example, people can receive on their smartphones inflormation which route is crowded or where is an accident. Traffic congestion is an issue that is frequent in crowded cities .In conclusion, traffic congestion and pollution is a problem which have potential solutions available for each one.

However, there are not a lot of things to do there, specially if you are young. Two improvements that can make that place better for young people would be the oppening of a cinema and a shooping mall. First, the oppening of a cinema. Because is a small city, Coyhaique doesn't have a cinema. However, the winter is really cold and indoor activities are always appreciated. The oppening of a theater would be a great attraction for the people there, because people can relax and have fun in a comfortable chair and in a warm place. This improvement would help people to go out of their houses and in long-term it would even help with the economy of the city. Second, the oppening of a shooping mall. Coyhaique doesn't have a mall at all. If a shooping mall opens there, it would be a success because people can have access to a variety of stores in the same place. Young people love spend time in the mall, because they can do a lot of thing in one place. They can go shooping, eat, even have a haircut. Malls are a good place to spend time and get away from home. With the oppening of a mall, young people could have acces to new trends and in long-term have access to part-time jobs. This two oppenings, the cinema and the shooping mall can represent new distractions to young people, and they can spend a fun time outside of their houses.

Guatemala has the most beautiful landscapes that you can ever imagine.                    Most of the problems that Guatemala faces is the violence and corruption. If the president and all the council in Guatemala stops stealing money from the government and starts using the money to help people, Guatemala will change. The lack of schools, public health, and good hospitals makes inhabitants to loose control and to start doing bad things in order to receive attention and meanings.                  The main reason of violence is lack of food and money. What makes people steal? No good jobs opportunities and that leads to poverty. A racional person will never steal if they have the meanings and if they have food and a safe place to live. People steal because they need food to eat and clothes to wear. They do not have money because they do not have jobs.

However, young people is getting lazy. Boredom is dominating the city! Of course there is a solution for this. Actually, the solution for this is the same solution for all wordly problems or issues: soccer. Soccer will increase the young citizens physical activity, diminish depression and other psychological issues, and probably make the city a more attractive place for tourists.      First, people in Santiago is getting fat. Government has taken some measures about it, but they have not worked. In order to fight this global issue, it is important to incentivate physical activity. There is no better option for this than soccer. People love soccer! If the government invest money in soccer infrastucture, tournaments, and advertisments; they will have healthier schools, collegues, and families.     Second, Santiago is a very contaminated city in every sense, and it as been reflected in people phychological illness. Statistically, illness as depression, are increasing dramatically. The best solution for this, according to experts, is practizing a sport. Chileans favorite sport is soccer; therefore, Chile should incentivize this practize in order to reduce psychological issues.   Third, cities, such as madrid, had been empowered by soccer (speaking about tourism). Today's global sport is soccer, and if a country is good at this all the rest of the world is going to put their eyes on it. Chile has good soccer players who won the American Cup last year. However, this can increase if Santiago's government concentrate its efforts on this topic. If they do as it was illustrated before, the interest other countries manifest for Santiago will experience a raise beyond expectatives.      Conclusively, an amazing city, as Santiago is, can be improved by the development of today's most important sport: soccer.

Many youg adults move from hometowns to cities becuase there are more job opportunities in cities. One improvement that would sovle this problem is creating more job opporunities for young adults. All citizens will be benefit by this new policy, such as the high quality of lifestyle and the developing relationship between families.First, having more job opportunties will attract many young adults have more desires to come back to their hometowns and countries. People will leave their hometowns and countries because there are inadequant job opportunites and less salaries. For example, creating more job opportunities and increasing payments will help people have sufficient money to support and forster their families. Therefore, it is quite significant to create job oppurtunities and rase payments to attract more people to move back. This improvement will balance the whole society to have higher quality of lifestyle.Second, the long-term consequences of this improvement is developing the closed relationships between families, such as parents. Many elders and children are abandent because young people need to work in other places. Many educated and societal problems are caused because of unbalance populations. For instance, many grandparents do not know how to educated their grandchildren because of the age gaps. If those young people come back, those problems will solve and the relationships will be better. Hence, this is the long-term consequence of this improvement. Cultivating a good relationship takes time and their generations need those young people to help.In sum, there are many improvements that young adults stay in their hometowns and countries. If the govenment can provide more job opportunities and raise payments, more and more young people are willingness to go back. More and more different levels of populations will have many benefits in the future, like  optimal relationships.",4.64W17 LATs,30971,"A few months ago I lived with my family.

Practice one sport can help a lot for have more organization in the live because you can learn to be a more responsable person. for this reason Oaxaca my state need  to  improve this skill. Practice sports can help to have a better place to live because the young people can have more opportunities when they know about discipline for practice one sport. I choose practice one sport because in the most discipline cities in the world the people who practice one sport in their childhood can be a better citizens in the future. Now I am going to explain the principal reasons fore pracrice one sport in my state and city.First, Oaxaca my city needs to have more space for do sports. A lot of schools in my city do not have the good intalations for practice sport. For this reason a lot of young people can not practice a sport because if you like to practice something you need to pay a lot. I think that if each school have better instalations the sport in my city and my country will improve. They can beneffit with opportunityes that help to practice their favorite sport. Roght now my city has a few schools that have everything for practicibg a sport. But in the most poor places do not have nothing for practice a sport. This is a really hard situation because they do not have money for pay instalations to practice a sport. One solution for this problem is talk with the government in my city. Because they need to know that practice one sport can be really good for the live to young people. They need to help all the schools in my city for have better spaces to practice the sport and I think that they need to give the sufficient money for build different spaces inside the schools. Second, practice one sport it is really helpful to have a better organize live because a lot of studies said that practice one sport can improve your healthy and help your brain for think better. For this important reason if the young people in my state practice on esport I am sure that they will improve thgeir grades in the school and they will have a more healthy live. In these months I saw the importance for practicing a sport in United States. This country help the students for practice one sport. And I think that if the government in my city help all the students in a couple of years Oaxaca my state can has a better citizens with good healthy. Practice one sport help you to have more discipline in your live. If the youth in Oaxaca practice a sport I am sure that thay can be more responsable in their actions. My city and state need more  young people with f this qualities for improve in different skills. In conclusion, if Oaxaca has the opportunity that the young people know how to practice a sport I am totally sure that all the youth can know how to have a better live with practicing one sport. This situation can change the future for a lot of children because if you help them they can do a lot of things for have a better future. Practice one sport can be a type of live. The sports change the personality for the people because they can be more responsable people. In my opinion I think that my state needs this improvemnet because a lot of young people have a good potential in their lives for being a really good athlethes.",4.65F15 LATs,91040,"I am living with my roommates.

She has many sibilings!","There are many important accepts that would make my city a better place to live foy young people like me for several things. If we can image these things, we can make more great society and we can creat more great for young people.      First of all, we need more schools. If we have many schools in my city, the city will be bright. It means, we can be one. For exmple, if there are many school, many student live around there. And, if something happen such as earthquake to this city, the people can help each other. So, if we have many schools in this city, we can be one.Here is another exmaple, that is many club such as basketball club, bollyball club, baseball cub. So, they usually have a match with another school's sports club. Becasue if that, they can be a friend. So, if there are many schools, many people who is young age can help each other if somthing happen. These will become benefits for them.Second, if they have more volunteer, it will be great for them. Sor exmple, is they do volunteer around their school, the people who live in around the school can feel confortable. It means, the school will be popular. And also, if they do voluntter, they can learn another thigs. Mybe, they will think grateful about anythings. And fortunately, sometimes, they can enter great college if the proffessor of the college hear about the school that is great. Therefore, if they have activity such as volunteer, it will be benefits for them.     Finally, if many young people live there, they can make many friends. For example, if many young people live there, if will be great for old people. It means, there are many old people who worked hard before have children or grandchildren. If their children or grandchildren increase, they will be happy. And also, the young people can hear about past story such as a histry from old people and they can get new knowledge. getting new knowledge is very important accept. Therfore, I think the young people need to do these things.     I think many people who is young people is the key of our future.  If the people can be great, and do volunteer activity, hear about many things from their paretns or their grandfather of grandmother, it makes this city great. And also, if they do these things, they can get many benefits. therfore, if the people who is young do these things, they can improve this city and can be better place to live for them.",4.65F15 LATs,78293,"People that I lived together in the past is Thomas who was my roommate. He was kind but lazy. First of all, he and I were hometeaching companion. During we were hometeaching, he showed his kindness to others. He always took care of them and showed his love. Second, he was a lazy person. For example, he never washed his dishes that he used. After he cooked, the kitchen was always scattered. Mainly, his characters are interesting because he was kind, but he was lazy. For these reasongs, it was sometimes difficult to live with him but also memorable. I learned what I should show love to others even if I am busy or in trouble. I am glad that I had a chance to live with him. To sum up, I learned inportant aspect to live happily.","Many areas try to improve in various areas, such as agricultures, indutries. etc. These improvement for the city that you live help people live easily or effectively. Some people do not care what changes in their cities. However, improvement is crucial and people need to be careful about their lives. The improvement help people's lives facillitate. One thing that Provo and Salt Lake City would better adapt is transportation. If they have more transportations, that would be helpful for people especially students in short-term. Furthermore, people's lives will thrive in long-term.          A transportation is needed to invent more in order to help people's life effectively in Provo. In the U.S., American people have a huge land. If there is a way to transport people or materials quickly, that is a benefit. If people can transport easily, they would go traveling, shopping, and so on. For example, international students who do not have cars, they try to avoid going outside if they do not have enough transportations. This is a problem of reducing to transport people. If they can transport quilckly and easily, they would go outside. This is the short-term consequence.          Secondally, if the transportation is more provided, many products or food will be available easily. This is the long-term consequence if they have more effective transportations. Transportations are not only for people but also products. There are a lot of food that can grow in certain situations. Utah people have certain their products. If there is a way of tranporting those materials, they will earn more money by transporting certain products that they have. Moreove, they will get more products from other areas. This is the long term-consequence.          To conclude, the one improvement that Provo would better adapt is effective and sufficient transportations. If these are accepted, students' life would be more beneficial. They will have transportations, and move around. Consequeces, they consume various more products. Therefore, their economy will be going up because of their cunsume. It is recommended to have more transportations.",4.65S17 Placement,10365,"Throughout my life time, there's ben several people who have served me and loved. This is why I want to give a great shoutout to my awesome mission companion whom I have been as well friends with and have spent time together having fun.To me, a friend must be somebody who invites me to try new experiences all of the time, things that edify my and get me out of my comfort zone.Andrew has been such an example to me. People at times say we look similar, but his a lot cooler.He loves being in touch with gospel related things, his time is never spent in vain. He loves serving and doing everything in his power to help you out.He'll never say 'no' but will always have  better answer to give you when you're not right.He's very worried abot his responsabilities, he doesn't miss one, he's on top of everything.Living with him, in the mission and after, has been a great experience. Shows me that the Lord doesn't let alone at any time.","I'm from a third world country where most of the things are private and limited. There is an endless list of things to improve, because the goal is to form a place where a future group of young men and women may learn the basics of success, a place where society doesn't deny anybody the opportunity to progress. Since there is a ton of things to talk about, I'd like to emphasize one that I've noticed is holding many from progression.About 7 years ago, the Government created a new organization, which was encharged of the direction of the recent graduates from high school to college, or anybody who wanted to study in what became 'public' universities.Studying privately meant to much of a sacrifice if the family was poor, so getting through a test to apply to a public university seemed to be a great opportunity. However, this way of applying limited many of the desires of these people, placing them where they didn't want to be, but at the same time, filtering the ones that actually wanted to be prepared.As years passed by, new policies where made in order to study for free. The test that is taken to allow people to study has a top score of a thousand, and many different carrers required, or demanded, students to get very close score.This caused many to be where they didn't want to be, since you applied not for just one career with your score, but four, and it all depended in availability.People took the chance to do something different from what they originally wanted, and as time passed by, they ended up withdrawing. That is a feeling most people have when they're not comfortable.Policies continued to change, and the opportunity now to study at a public university became muchmore limited. Lately, the government decided that only students from public schools are allowed to study at publich universities. All these many students that went to private schools could not have the chance to be at the  public universities.Private school, elementary or high school, are not necessarily expensive, but parents choose these options ensuring the safety of their children because public school are very dangerous.This is why many parents are taking the risk to send their children to foreing countries, to become better prepared.The solution sounds to be a change of people's minds, since they are the ones who choose who they want to govern them, because to change a governor is much harder.I love my country and I'd love to be part of the inmediate solution.",4.65W17 LATs,47779,"When I start the semester in ELC I was living in alta apartments, it was my first time that I live with 5 other person, well acutally was 6 because 1 other guy stay in the apartmen for 1 month, Was really interesting, everyone was American and only my was from other country. In the house half of the house speak my lenguage and the other half not, so they traet me very well, I could understand and have a converzation with them. My roomie with who share the room, He was a grat person with me, He help me with my homework many times, I am very greatfully for that with him,  He speaks my language also, because He serve his mission in my language, I am very looky. He also is very reserve with his emotions. The most that I like with live with all this guys in the same apartment was that We are all differents personalities, however was very exiting. In summary living with more people from another culture is amazing, everyone is respectfully with the other, and also you can learn a lot about them and their families. In addition I make very good friends, and I hope that we can ve in contact for a while.","My city is a very beautiful place for live but if I can do one improvement that would make my city a better place for live I think that I should make a change in the administation of the politician people in my city. They are not the best people, always they improve areas in what their family lives and not the rest of the city. They forgot what they promise in their campain. Young people do not believe in politician, many of them did not go to give his vote to anyone of them, everyone lie, young people in my city in not longer trust in them. Firstly,  politician in my city need be more care about all the comunity and not only for the rich part. I remember in classes when teacher speak about Shakleton the big leader and explorer. If we think in this old history,  shakleton was traveling in the antartic and they were lost and all his tripulation was with him, 21 persons in his ship, but he promise them that they are going to be fine, and ask for they to trust him and work togethers, They believe in them and with a lot hope and hard work they could resist the travel and come back to England, shakleton never give up, because he have many man in his tripulation who trust in him, so he give them the example to resist everything. However if a politician could be more like Shakleton and care more about his people, the people in his comand or in this case the city, they would follow him and they are going to trust in him and together can do many imposibly stuff. Young people is the future.Finally,  politician need be profetionals . Old people normally have a good experiences in their lifes, but that is not longer the most important, politician needs be more creative, some times they neeed take risks and faster. Normally that are caracteristics of young people. People in the city needs trust to people who is proffetional in what they do. For example, if we have a envioreenment minister,  the best people for that position is at enviorement engienniering. I saw this example when I was living in Canada, and I know that works.In summary, for improve my city I know that politians people needs change, young people in the city wants that, they want believe and trust in good leaders, I need trust too. Politicians needs be persons with experiences, proffetionalism and good leaders. I would follow them and I know that my young people of my city too. Young people is the future of the city, and the city it will improve.",4.66S17 Placement,76525,"I live with a couple of roomates. We being throug a lot of experiences together.

These two characterists I would love to have in my country that I am from. My name is David Vilela and I am from Peru I would like to explain to you why I would love to have this two characteristic in my home country. I am not saying that my country is not a beautiful place to live  or is not a well developed country but I am sharing here that they could do better. Peru is a country that has all of the resources that a country needs to be a well developed country but they really not know how to well use it.   First at all, to have a beautiful place to live a country needs a lot of work to be done. This work require a lot of effort on the side of the government. People who have the power to move things, an money that can be move as well. Who better people than them. the government can start making plans and they can hire people for the job as well. Having a special program of  cleaning and improving the beauty of the country will benefit our country with more turists, more turists more income for the country, more income for the country means there will be more money for this type of improvement that we need.Next, It is important to have a lot of developments in our country and  new things that people can get interested to. Like all things and like the last part that I explain that is important to have a plan in this case is really esential to make plans and to make a program just for developments. I know that governments have programs for infraestructures and  ideas about fixing all old historical buildings but I would like them to create program about this specific topic new developments. Construction of bypasses, construction of well looked building, etc. If they have people which is thinking about just this program will benefit the country and the view of other people who have a bad opinions about it.  In conlusion, I have being living in a place that have great ideas and great resources that they can use to improve it but  the people incharge did not use them at all because they were focusing more in the political and economical aspects for the benefits of themselves. I am suggesting that if we have the right people and these two things that I just mention  in this essay we can have a beautiful and well developed place to live to be proud of. For may years I have been ashamed of my country because of the lack of this two things in my country.",4.66F15 LATs,03705,"Grace was my roommates in my university time and my best friend.

But how it could become a better place? Government should encourage young people to build their own buisness by some beneficial policies.        First, the city has a big pupulation but not enough working oppotunities. Young people who are just graduate form college do not have working experience before and the working positions are not enough. As a result, there is a saying in my city,' graduation is unemployment.' Many young student cannot find a job after graduation. So they had to studying for a higer education or just stay at home. If the government take actions to help young people to run their own besiness, they can work for their own.     Second, the policies are potential because the need exists. Encouraging young people to run their own business like opening a company could not only build a job for that young people, but also build new working positions for more people becuse the company need employers. Government can reduce the cost of buliding a company so that it is easier for young people. Furthermore, the government can build the business union to help young people running their buisness so that they can make success easier.    Last,  this action is beneficial in a long run. We can see that it helps reduce the unemployment. In one way, some young people can work for themselves. In other way, more working positions were created. Then it helps the local economy.For instance,these new private businesses borden the market. They can do some new busness that the existed companies barely do before like online shops. Also more compines means more taxes. the government could use these money to invest new busness.   In conclusion, government should makes some good policies to encourage and help young people to build their own buisness. It can not only reduce unemployment but laso stimulate the local economy.",4.67F15 LATs,73031,"My New Neighborhood.There are some differences that my new neighborhood rather than my old neighborhood.

The comunication give us the best way for bussines and some task of each day. Also, the comunication brings more facilities in the city to solutions problems about something. The technology helps in the things about registracion of a person in the system of the goverment. Thus, the people can obtain more informacion about of the city.

Moreover, the transportacion can bring some kind of products from other countries,and we can enjoy these things to learn about them.         In conclusion, the technology brings a lot of opportunities to improve our city.

My city should to have more recreational activities for the following reasons. In the first place, my city should have more recreational activities because it will imporve teenager's unification. Students, for example, are spending too much time playing video games and watching TV instead of spending time with their families and friends. Specifically, it affects negatively the unification of young people and as a consequence, many teenagers are falling in depression and are consuming drugs. Therefore, having friends will imporve their motivation to overcome their challenges and better themselves.In the second place, my city needs to have more recreational activities because it will increase teenager's population. To illustrate,  young people are attracted to cities that are having music, art, clothing and technology events, and having more events in my city will get the attention of many young people and most of them will have the strong desire to move to my city.Finallly, my city should to have more recreational activities because students will have more opportunities to be relaxed.

In other words, students are too stressed and their grades in school and health begin to decrease. In fact, it is crucial that students should to have more activities in order to  be relaxed.Clearly, having more reacreational activities will imporve student's life quality.

In my city there are many people who like to do exercise; however, not all of them have money to spend in a Gym so it would be good to open areas with exercising equipment like in other cities. Some benefits of opening areas where people can work out are that people can save money, people would be more healthy and in shape. There are some cities that provide parks with exercising equipment where people can work out for free. This would be very good to the people in my city because in my city if you want to work out or do exercise you have to go a gym and pay a tuition. Therefore, if the goverment opened this kind of areas with exercising equipment , more people would  have access to place to work out and others could save money.Another long term consequence for opening areas with exercising equipment is that people would be in shape. A problem in my country in these last years is obecity because they do not have a correct diet and because they do not do exercise. However, if the government opened these areas, more people would go an exercise because they do not have to spend money and also they could go at any time because it would  be a park a public place. As a result, there would be more healthy people and in shape.In my city there are many places to eat with friend and family, to go dancing and also parks.

I am member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and I would like to have places where people my age can feel safe and welcome. There is a Church close here but that is not enough for us, I think we could create a program like in the States to have all the young people united. I have many friends in the States who has been raised here or have been studying for a long time, and there is a big difference in them. They have meetings, parties or opportunities to connect with people their age and with the same standards. I can't see this in my city now.

I know that it is not a good idea to bring all of them here but I am very convinced that we can do much to create a program in Lima Peru to help the young people, especially Mormon people to be and stay in holy places.When I think about holy places I don't think only about temples or churches, but places like a friend's house or activities where people my age can feel the Spirit and be together far from the Satan's wickedness. I have always thought if there are people building discos or clubs to get money selling alcohol or ciggarettes, we can do all the contrary creating healthy activities for our Mormon community outside the States. We could use more our churches during the week. They are places where we should be more often. I dream with the day that we can hang out with friends and feel not so tempted or in danger.  Imagine the impact that we could have in some years. I could name some of the inmediate consequences: Young people with a stronger desire to serve missions or get married at temples. Wow, is not this amazing? It is. We can do this a reality. Dreaming is not sufficient. We have to do things now to change our future and of those who will be born. We can do that the Provo's culture expands around the world creating programs and healthy activities. We do not need to invest a lot of money to do this. To start we can use our own buildings more.  I don't know how this works in other countries but in my experience today we tend to use the Church only on Sundays.

First, the education is the main key to eliminating  the poverty. Second, the education brings great oppportunities to achieve your goals. Third, the education helps you to live in peace and love.      The education is the main key to eliminating the poverty because it is an investment. You invest your time for studying in different institutions to learn essential things like read, talk, and write. There are many young that is out to school because do not have the wish to learn more. It is a great problem because when they are adult, they cannot have sufficient money to survive.     The education bring great opportunities to achieve your goal.

In Colombia you need to know what you want to study and sometimes it's really difficult to be accepted and if during your major you realize that it's not for you.... they don't give you the same oportunities that you can find here. I sincerily believe that if the goverment applays ideas like this, people from my age could have more aportunities in their futures lifes.  Thinking about the long - term consequences of this improvement I would say that the situation in Colombia could be better. It's so sad to see people in Colombia who has a nice major but for any reason  they are homeless right now. Can you Imaging this? Study so hard for 4 or 5 years and then don't find a place where you can aplay the things you learned. Doctors or Profesional people driving taxis or something like that, just because the can't find a place to work. It makes me really sad. That's why I feel so blesed to be here. Studying in this University and In this place. I want to give my best because I know that with the education Im going to recieve here I will have more oportunities in Colombia. This is what I want for city and for my country. I want a better education, with the same oportunities for everybody. And I know people my age would be so grateful with this change.",4.71W16 Placement,88372,"Right now I live with the Raymond family. There are for people i theire family.

I live in a big city called Odessa thats placed in Ukraine. That is beautiful city that has over one million people living in it. This city is right by the Black Sea, so it has a lot of turists every summer. If I would have chance to change something in my city, probably I would add more bicycle lines on the rodes. This will help to prevent traffic in down town and also a lot of accidents with cars and bicycles on the streets. Talking about people my age I will say that everyone will enjoy this change. A lot of young people ride bikes and they always have problems on the roads, because they dont have enough room with cars. Other benefit is clean environment. If you are riding a bicycle you are not poluting the air. We have a lot of people coming every summer for vacations with their familys and I think that they will enjoy good environment. On the other hand drivers will feel more comfortable driving their cars, because they dont need to worry about people that are riding bikes. Everyone will have their own lane on the road and if no one brakes driving rools such as crrosing double lanes everybody will be safe. There are a lot of benefits for people of my age in this change. I am twenty two years old and I like two ride on my bicycle. If I will have a separete  line on the road for riding a bike it will make my life safer, because I go to fast and a lot of times drivers in a big cars can not see me. Talking about long-term consequences I would say that everyone will learn how to drive safely and drivers will start to respect people that are ridding their bicycles, because they will not be on their way. Also more people will start using bikes, because thay will feel safer on tha roads.",4.71W17 LATs,82512,"Nowadays, I live with my little son.

The principal problem is relate to young people, they do not have public spaces and they spend their time in negative activities. My government has to implement beneficial programs for young people. Building public places and incrementing the investment in education will be the key to develop a new society.First, more public places for young people and families. My town has a huge problems,  there are not enough public places to practices some sports. In addition,  young people use their time in negative activities, such as gans or drugs. In contrast, Provo has many public places for families, young people, an so on. This will be a good example, and my authorities should copy those examples. It is clear that more public places will help in a short-term because young people will develop health activities; and long-term because young people will avoid drugs and there will be less gans. Second, in relation to education. Authorities of my country must invest in schools. Since elementary schools to high school, even public universities. The money from taxes has to be used in more computers, books. Moroever, it is well known that many students do not have breakfast. The government must implement a food program for all student. It will help not only students, it will help the society. In short -term, this program will increase  rate of students at school. In a long-term, it will be beneficial for the society. It is evident that education is the key to improve my city.In conclusion, young people are the future in a socierty. Peruvian authorities have to develop beneficial programs, such as building  more public places and investing in education because young people in five years will decide who will be the next president, they have to be educated",4.72W17 LATs,76008,"Since Sring of 2014, Im living with the same roomates.

It is located in the coast of Peru, in front of the ocean. Lima is a city when people can do different activities such as surfing, go to the theater, go to museums, etc, but there are some things that make people to do not do this activities. There are many things that the government need to improve for make Lima a better place to live.First, Lima is unsafe. Lima is an unsafe place. Compare with Provo, the city where I live in, Lima is very unsafe. In Lima in everyminute a crime is happening. A lot of people is tired of this because make them to de afraid and alert all the time. Also, there are places that people cannot go in several times as night or there are other places that they cannot go in all the day because it is always dangerous. The government should improve the security in Lima becaus eis decreasing the national and international turism in the city.Second, Lima has really bad streets. Almost all the streets in :ima are destroyed. This happening for many situations such as earthquakes, the excessive weight, etc. The government did not give to them the maintenance that they needed and for that reason the structures are not good. This is causing people to be very mad because everyone is paying taxes for the maintenance of the city, but this is not happening. The government should fix the streets for make the city more beautiful. Third, the trafic in Lima is caotic. The trafic is Lima is horrible. A lot of people spend more than one hour just waiting for the car to move. This is not just happening in some parts of the city , this is happening in almost all the city between 6 to 8pm because that is the time when people go out of their jobs. Some of the people who are more affected by this are college students and employers who are in the central part or south parth of the city because it is where the trafic is more horrible that other parts. Also, the way how the public and private transportation is organizate in Lima is not the best. The government should improve the organization of the transportation for make the life of al lot of people better. Finally, Lima has several things that make it a beautiful and unique city , but there are things that are disturbing their populations. Some of the reasons are security, structure of the streets and traffic. this things are affecting the life of the people and make them more unhappy. The government should improve all these things for help people to have a better and calm life.",4.73W17 LATs,34504,"Living with my mission  compaions is easier that live with extrange people.

This is a city that do not have enough places to practices sport. As a important part of the dairly life, having more place to practice sport would be a better place to youth. It would make them  being less stressful and out of drugs.     Frist, being less stressful is a very important part of the life for youth, then having paces to practic sport with help them. With all the stress that youth precent because school, work, and taking important desision is essential being helty to do not have to care about that. A example of that is there are many people that use running to have time to forgot about their problems of all the thing that they need and be less stressful. Fortheremore no every one like to run, some people like to playing soccer, tennis, bascketball,  etc. If young people do not have the space to practice this sport they just will not do it. Then it will make then do not practice sport and make them more stressful.     Second,drugs is a general problem  in the youth in this days. Youth are more likely to being in drugs that other people because they do not have others thing to do. With the bad influence in the youth, is very dangerous give them the chance to try drugs. Even though drugs is a personal desision, the enviroment can have a good influence in that desision. To illustrate, when youth is involve in sport they do not have enough time to be tented in trying drugs because thery are useing their time. On the other hand when youth do no have this kind of attivities they are more likely to being in drug because the free time thet they have and no a good enviroment. For thes reason paces to play sport are very important in fighting drugs because they are a good enviromet to be out of it.      To conclude, practicing sport have a good influence of youth life. As they have the oportunity to relax of their stresses lifes playing their fivority sport or being in a good enviroment to do not being in drug.

Barranca is a rich city on natural resources, oil is one of them, there are a lot of companies around the area, but just a few universities. Barranca needs more colleges because people have to improve their level of educations; thus the economy in the city will improve.First of all, the more education people obtain the better living condition they will have. Barranca has all the transportation that it is needed to take advantage of the economy. It also have an gigant refinery of the most important company in Colombia. They work to look petroleum around the area to transform it into products to consume such as gas. However, corruption in government, and some other companies that want to monopolize the market do not allow people in the city improve their living conditions. That is why, it is not convinient for them to bring more univiersities that people may obtain high education, and then get a better job or possitions inside a company. The universities that Barranca has are not good enough to supply the demand of the oil market. Those schools try to do their best, but when a young professional who has graduated from one of this college is going to look for a job, those companies reject this young because the school does not have the qualities to educate this professionals. Therefore, this young people would not have the opportunity to improve their living conditions and make progress in their lives. Second, the more universities, the more options people can choose to study to become educated and help with improvements in the city. When people obtain more education, it is more likely that a city become more civilized, clean, and well known. Cities where there are poor levels of educations are more likely to maitain poor living conditions. Barranca needs a lot of schools people can choose want they really need to study to work on improvements in social, cultural, healthy, economy issues. However, in this situation, education is only for rich people who have the opportunity to pay for their children's education in a different city that offers what they are looking for to obtain the job they want in the time they have to come back to barranca to work. So there is going to be same people or family who is going to be rich because there are the only ones who have this opportunies. In conclusion, education is most powerful key that goes against porverty. Barranca as a wealthy city in many diferent natural resources needs more school that bring posibilites of improvements, and help young people to grow and improve their living conditions helping the city to grow in the same way.",4.74W17 LATs,19559,"Now, I have the opportunity to live with roomates. They are different as me but it is one think that I really like. I am going to describe to of them. The first one is Nancy, she is from Mexico. I met her at the ELC, we were classmates. We started to live together 4 months ago. She likes cook and listen music. She is really active and it is one thing one think that I really like because when I do not have energy or I am not positive, she makes me feel better. Other thing that I really like is that she has the same job as me. That is important for me because I need to wake up early and does not matter how much noisy I am. She wakes up at the same time as me. However I cannot practice my english with her. And as a consequense Dayana is here. She is from UTAH, USA. She is really nice. Like Nancy she is very pretty positive. And she has the patient and time to practice with me mi English. She works at the MTC as a teacher because she is a return missionary. She has the spirity. She always has different ways to solve a problem, including my problems. Have roomates is one of the experiences that I really like.","The place where we live is important in our life. It is not only for us, it is for our children and our grandchildren. We have to take care and try to make better for us. Because we are here, I am here, you are here, and all of us are the person that we can make the difference. The improvement that would make our city better place to live is clean our streets. It has many benefits as make that we love our city, stop the pollution and be an example for people around us. When people love the place where they live, they enjoy go out and try to find things to do. How they can love their town if it is dirty always? It is impossible. In other hand when the streets are clean, people like to go out with their family and play or have a picnic. In many cases look their town clean make people happy, does not matter that they are not doing excersice, the action that involve only go out and hear the bird singing make them happy.We live in a place where the pollution have a huge problem nowadays. Maybe we cannot change the all things around us, but we can start for little things. If we only take out the trash that other persons leave on the streets, we can prevent that animal dead. It is not necessary go far away in looking for trash. We can go outside and see that we have trash around us. If we start to take out and clean the streets. We can perserve our city not only for us, at the same time for our future generations.Last, the best reason, be the example for our family or our friends. It is not neccesary be noisy or do big project with the porpuse that poeple known you. The only thing that you need to do is try to be different. And maybe we are not going to have an gift or money. But we are going to have the piece and the happiness that serve gives. In conclusion, try to clean the strees are not going to help just to the place where we live, this action are going to help us as makes us happy and be active and at the same time help the world and our future generations. Now, it is our decition, we can start our only stay in our home and look how the time is continuing. It is our choice.",4.74W17 LATs,85052,"I live in an aparment with four roommates.

I have always thought that it must be difficult to improve or increase an element to make a city a better place to live because it requires time to do it.  If I have the opportunity of choosing one element to improve in my country it would be education.  There are two main reasons of why I will choose education. The first main reason is because there are a lot of children or even teenagers that are not being educated correctly and firmly. The second reason is because education is not being a career that a teacher do with passion.       Nowadays, teaching children and teenagers is very important because they are our successors and they must learn much better that the actual generacion if we want to make a city a better place to live. Education is the motor, battery and the principle fundamental of our life, everything is turning around education and we have to learn well. However there are some children and teens that are not being educated correctly and firmly. Most of them do not want to go to school and they do not want to learn about courses at school.  Why is this happening? For example, in Chile, most of the children and teens are getting tired of studying and doing homework, but I can infert that maybe teacher are not doing their jobs very well and this can be the consequence.      Education is not being paid correctly as it should be. There are a lot of people who love teaching, but they do not earn good enough for their stuff and daily lives. For example in Chile, my country, I experimented that my teachers were tired of teaching very well but earning pretty bad and it is still being a huge problem because teacher get sick of teaching and they start doing their jobs but without passion. A carrer that do without passion, can become really bad for you fisically and mentally over the time.      In conclusion, I would improve education in all its senses because it is essenciall for our life and for our successor. Education is one of the most important things for our success and future and we need to try to make it better. The change start for you even though other person do not do it, just try to start making the change or improvement by yourself and give the example to children. Education must be teaching with all passion and effort because by this we can start to make our cities a better place to live in.",4.76W17 LATs,11156,"Living in Provo, Utah and in a place where you have different roommates is a good experience. In the past I used to live with a family and now I am living with five American girls.  These girls tought me many things in life. They have different personalities, but each of them is special.  All of them are BYU students, they work during the morning at the campus ansd at the MTC in Provo. Something that I like living with them is that when come back from school or work, someone will ask how was your day, or how was work, and also they will ask you if you had something interesting during the day. Then, if someone want to watch a movie or a tv serie episode, all of us will join at the living room and watch it. I realized that these girls thought  me how to be part of this family now. Maybe in the future they will need to move out, but I will always remeber them as a part of this experience called 'student life'.","Looking for a place where to live is something thayt everyone will choose. One of the improvements that the city where I live right now can do is to have more places where we can spend time learning different languages such a emarging schools. People in different ages can learn another languages when they are children or teenagers instead to wait until middel school or high school, they will develop another skills with their second language, and be able to support others during the transition of learning another language.Firsty, learning another language could be a challange in life. Most of the time people do not take that kind of risk about learn a foreign language. It  can be helpful in life; especially because children  and teenageers are in their grow up transition,  children are be able to learn so fast which shows us that they will have an anvantage from others. As a second point, children and teenageers  can develop new skill when they learn another language. Speaking a foreign language can help you to develop your listening and speking. Also, it will be a good exercise to put you brain work.  It is not a easy way, but as you can work so hard and dedicated, Children are teenagers. As an example, if you teach a  little five years old boy. He will be willing to learn so fast. ON the other hand teenageers also have the capacity to leanr quickly and be able to be involve in that.Third, learning another language will provide you the oportunity to help others, traveling around the world is something that each of us probably can do it. Knowing more about culture, dance, and art. Can help to be around people from all around teh world. Which will means that this transition between  to talk and learn is one of the steps that you need to follow in order to learn and speak  another language.All in all, getting an extra language to your life will increase your posibilities to open your mind and your ayes into a different world.  Woth this idea  as a part of the imporovement on the city that I live in can be very beneficial for everyone. Also, it will create a wonderful place when you can have a diversity of languages. Finally, people will have the attemp to support this idea or not. In the future as a long term goal, people will be able to speak more than just their own language.",4.77W17 LATs,89653,"During mi mission there was a timen in which I lived with other 2 elders in the same apartment, besides my companion and I. It was super fun. We usually plan together for the day and share our espiritual and personal experiencess. I remember one day one of the beds got broke so two of us had to sleep in the flor,  I had to sleep in the flor for a week before someone from the office brang the new base for our bed. However, when the elders from the office brang the base it was super hard to get it to our apartment because we lived in the 5th flor of a bulding, and the base did not fit in the elevator. So, it was three in the morning and there we were in our pijamas carring a base using the building stairs. I will never forget that night. Our apartment was small, it was perfect for two people but not for four; I lived one of my best experiences in that appartment anjoying the friendship with the other elders.","Nowadays in my city, it is hard to find places in which  people can express themsleves, and when people finally find one they encounter that the environment is dangerous do to the use of alcohol or drugs. I have friends that went to those ares to express their talents, fealings, emotions, etc. and they change in a negative way because of those areas. So, if those areas change people why not change the areas to change the people in a positive way instead of a negative one.Create more areas in which people can express themselves with a positive environment can help our community to be more stable.Most of the times people do not know where they can express themselves having a positive environment other than with their friends. We all have friends with whom we feel secure and safe. We have this friend who has an inate ability to hear and to give us his opinion. However, the experience of our friend may be limited due to different reasons like for example, age, life style, etc. So, what if we create an area in which all the people who get in the area become best friends of everyone in that room. This will create a perfect and positive environment to help people to express themselves openly and without fear. By having this express yourself area, people will get to know other people from their communities helping the community to create a strong relationship between their memebers. Due to the interaction between people they will get to know better and better creating bonds that will help the community in general. Because now they are not strangers it will have a positivi effect in the psychological  health of everyone who partisipates in these express yourself area; helping to have a happiest community.In conclusion, we will not just be helping individuals but whole communities by having a express yourself area in every community. There will be problems at the beginning, one of the hardest difficulties will be geting the people to trust in each other and to be friendly with each other. However, regarthless this impediments, it is for shure that one of the outcomes of this experiment will be a happiest community, and it has been proved that a happy comity is a helthier and productive one.",4.77W17 LATs,99076,"I have lived with many differetn people aroun me,but I think  that one the most important person now is my fiance Adriana.

One thing that i enjoyed when I was there was the fact that we spent much time together for example watching movies, eating  out home and the mos important part giving us love each other.

My home city is really small it manes Tuxtepec Oaxaca, in this city people do not have many resources or job opportunities.One thing that clould make my city better is the fact that if the goverment invests more money  in jobs my city will grow in a significant way. I will adress why this change in my city will be a benefit a, how this change will help the population and finally how it could promove people talking about a long term.A city is important for how many job it has and how many emplyess it has as active. When a city does not have many people working or low employss range it is an small city it meand without many advantages for thir population. In the case of Tuxtepec Oxaca it is a small city becuse in ti does not has a lot of job or peole working. If the govertment works for this problen every person in the city could have a better standar of loiving it means better services such as clean wather, healt care, good incomes, and education. The goverrtment can invest in new job , small jobs that can help families to have thir own mony and not work for others, in thes way with more jobs or in this case small ones can be more mony in the city and it has a good ecconomy.A good example of good ecconomy in one city is Mexico city, it has millons of people in it , and for that reason there are more oportunities. If the govertment in Tuxtepec invest on for example a new company or factory that action will give more oportunities more money in the city and better activities or services. In Mexico city many thigs are cheap becuse exist a big demant of all of those things, unlike in small cities sometimes them does not has all the things or services and in consecuence those are more expensive that the normal cost. In this way more jobs not only will help the oportinities, It will helps the pries of the different ecential things.Finally this kind of changes will affect directly to the next generations , becuse if rigth now everything change the future for our children wil be bettter. In sum Tuxtepec Oxaca today is a small city with the help of govertment it can be better grow and in some yars has a lot oportunities for our young people. everything can change if the goverment is more focues in the needs of the population.",4.77W17 LATs,39898,"My roommates are ok.

The government has many scholarsahip for students, but often times this scholarship does not benefit poeple with more needs. People from wealthy families get these scholarships as well, making society more unequal. In order to make an equal society for everyone, the government should improve the way to get this scholarship for food, transport and education.            The government should make sure that people with huge needs get the scholarship for food. Many students complain about the insufficient money they get to pay for food. Studying in Chile is tough, and many students know that very well. I have friends that got the scholarship for food, but it is not enough money for the month. They do not have time to work, and their parents need to pay for everything. There are students that do not have needs, and they got this benefit as well. If the govenment puts more attention to people that really need this benefit , the life quality of stufents will improve. Given this, there should be a stricter filter to help students with more needs.         Similarly, The benefits for transport have been decreasing drastically in the last years. Most of college students use public transportation to go to college. The price is increasing everytime and many of them cannot afford the ticket. The costs increase in big part for other people that do not pay their ticktes To avoid  a huge loss money, the government is increasing everytime. There is not a regulation and culture to pay the ticket. If the goverment try to put more enfasis to regulate the ticket payment, the cost for students will not increase as fast as it does. In a phrase, the regulation of public transportation will help students.      Finally, almost all the students from wealthy families have scholaships to study. Many people fake their papers income in order to get scholarships. This is a good improvement that the government coulsdmake to imrove the city for people of my age; to investigate of that person or student really need a scholarship or not. Many people would get benefits from this. According to the education ministery, I cannot apply to a scholarship due to my dad's income. My parents do no earn a lot of money to pay for my entire education, they price is similar in BYU, and that is why I left my city.

For example, they help me with the appartment, food, they teach me , and they practice english with e all the time. Also they are great examples as a persons.

I would refer especifictly to academic and extracurricular opportunities because we do not have many opportunities in those areas. We just finish the school and the university, after we begin to look for a good job so that we can provide to our famiy. We lack of great opportunities which could help us to develop in a higher way, accomplish our goals, and fullfill our dreams. This special situation make that a lot of people left my country, and i am a clear example of it. In the other hand, if we give more opportunities to all people who can guide and help our country to progress. Also i would like to be more specific about the opportunities and their concecuences. I would tall about academic opportunities and work opportunities.             My country is a place when we do not have the best education and technoloy which can help us to learn and get prepared to work. For example, medicine, computer science, business. My country does not have enought resources to teach in this areas; so, if we give better material and information, it can give them what they are looking for. If we help them to have all resources that they need, they will not have need to move to other country to look for better education and preparation; in contrast, thety will staye in my country. This can be a great change in the future because when we help them to e more prepared we can have a better country. For instance, we can have better hospitals, better doctors, more people who will trust in them.            As we help the country with academic opportunities, we will help them with work opportunities. One of the weeknessess of my country is that any big company is set there. For example, microsoft, sony, adobe, or the biggests businesses companies. In concequence we will never be able to work for them and have that opportunitie. So, if we change that kind of opportunities in can be very helpfull for young people, and we will no have the need to move to other country if we want to work for them, or if we receive a request from them.

People always are looking for the new improvements that cities may have. The opportuny to change is very helpful because you can work in the week areas that need more help with. Everyone need to start to look for the things that they want in life.Health care centers are the best way to help the future professionals.There are some things for the health care centers could help to improve a city.           First, Some people could have the opportunity to interact with others. People who always need to go to the doctor will be more benefit about that. The opportunity to talk with people from around the world is unique. When you have the opportunity to talk with other people you learn about the culture and the habits that a person has. However, all these things help you to learn about the different illness that people have. For example, when I was in my university in Ecuador I had the opportunitty to work with people at the health care center that help me to learn about how the people act when they are sick. This new proyect that a city could improve will help students to learn about the different illness that people could have. This proyect help the city to be more important in the heath area and some students from others regions will want to go there to practice and to gain that knowledge.         Second, young people could have experience helping others during the emergencies.

Also, These valuables activities are very value in life. Furthermore, the opportunity to be there will help you to learn about your own skills and abilities while you are working. For example, in Ecuador every student need to have practice hours on the health care center. This is a requirement, because the personality of the person is better while they are working. I had the opportunity to learn about my own skills and learn about how I help the people during their illness. For that reason, the most important thing that a city need to have is a health care center where the students could practice all their knowledge.       In conclusion, a city need to improve the health care centers because that will benefit their community. People could have the opportunity to help other people and learn about that situation. The students could have the experience for work in a hospital.

In fact, Medellin is the second important city in Colombia. It has about 3.5 million of population. Among that people, almost 60% is in their 30s. However, there are few things that the city can improve to become a better place to live for people in this ages. Among that points of improvement we can found the Transportation,  the investment on education and general security.           One of the important thinks to work in order to improve the city is Transportation. Comute in public transportation is expensive. That is the reason why the city has to create a new sistem to help people who is in the last time of college or university. People in this age are in the last years and they has to divide their time between work and study.  Nowadays, the city needs to  low the prices, maybe using special cards for students as an example. If they do that the results can be tha the students will be able to save money. That is a good improvement.         Then,  It is very important that the goverment think abount increase the investment on education.  If the cost of the public universities of colleges are reacheble for pleople in threir 30s, they can end the career and starts a major, even a doctor. This point helps the city because the level of education will be higher. More international factories o companies would be interested in hire more native people and the city will prosper. Besides, there are a lot of familys with an average incomes that would can pay the school. it is the second point of improvement.         Finally, If the city is a safe place to live in, many people rather to live there. It is important to have more police officers. They can help the pople. Students has a lot of stuff in their backpacks and need to get computers and cellphones. If there are more police on strets, they can walk more and be calm.  When the police force has more presence in the lives of the student comunity, there are more realxing enviroment. If they can trust in police officers, they can leave school late at night. That is the reason why the general security is important to improve in the city.        In conclusion, Medellin is a good place to leave, wonderfull place to study, specially for people in their 30s. Nevertheless, it is important to work in three points, such us get a cheaper public transportation, increase the investmen in the shools and get more police force to improve the general security.

In my point of view, A improvement that I would like to make in my country is to have high education in my city for serveral reason such as get access to high education for people, and my city will have better quality of life.      First, In my city young people do not have access to high education. If they want to continue their studies after high school they need to move to the capital city of my contry. For example, this student will be separate form his family because he will live in a other city faraway of his family. He will need to live with other people because they do not have enough to rent a private house or aparment. Moreover, some student will face the necesity to find a job to financial they live in the new city, so they will lose the focus on their studies, and sometimes they do not finish they degree because they have a lot of activities to do plus their studies. If these young people have the posibility to studie in their own city. they will be supporter for their family, and they will not face the necesity to get a job. Having high education in my city will help the student to compleat they studies quicky, and they will not lose the contact with their family.  Other important improvement that we can see from high education in my city, it will be the quality of the life of the people that live there. When people are preparated, they can find better job, and their life will be different because they will have access to others envieroment that they will not have with out a good education. For example, they can buy their own house, and they will feel more comfortable with they life because they are spending money in a house that will be for their when they finished to pay it. In addition, they will have more time free to spend with their family because they will earn well in their job, so they do not need to work more hours , or find other job to earn more money to support their family. They city will have more people prepared, and it will help to they city to grow up quickly. Because these people will earn more money, they city will earn more money from taxes, so they will apply these taxes to improve the environmnet of the city making better quality of life for their citizens.    To sum up, having better education in my city will facilite to young people to get access to high education, and they will have better quality of life when their receive their degree.",4.8F15 LATs,42517,"A couple of years ago, I used to live with a magician.

I tought she might be in this type of situation for many many years, because she was always realy good in turning the situation  on her favor and also the treiller idea was also cleaver.

All those differences combine in a very unique and especific way. The city where I live was lots of old people, because is calm, safe, and has a beautiful view of the lake. My city also has the best hospital in the entire world, they have the best technology and at that hospital the do all the most important researches for the health field. Because this city has a large number of elderly people, a improvement that the city should do to improve life quality would be a golf couse, because that will incentivate old people to socialize, exercice and compite.                Fisrt, golf is a calm and low pace game. This type of invironment help people to have time to socialize and get to know one another better. Elderly people especially use to appreciate games that are slow and gives the opportunity to chat and tell jokes and laught. FOr example, my uncle Bentz, after my aunty Joann passed away, met his second white, Morgan, at the golf course where they used to play together .                Second, golf is a low impact sport that requires lots of flexibility and elasticity. Those are two aspects that old people usually dont concern about and later they can develop issues and pain. Any type of exercise in beneficial to people of all ages, but elderly people need extra motivation to keep them in moviment. For example, my gradnma Anna used to go to the gym during all her life  time with my grandpa, they were gym buddy's. When my grandpa passed way, she got depression and felt so desmotivated to keep going to the gym. After a friend of her invited her to go with to a golf game, she fell in love with the game and ever since that day still playing it weeklly.             Last,  the competitivity of the game is a health and good activity to be engaged. Team players can work on strategies and ways to get extra points. Another benefit of the golf games is the funny and exciting rewards that they offer after the game. Participants gather together to find out the winners, the loosers that scored the worse, and to celebrate. Those rewarning prizes and fun and bring to the elderly people motivation.              For all those reasons, the city should have a golf course focusing the majority of the society, the elders.

Even though that they are sometimes tired because the school, they are happy when I take my friend to our apartment. For example, I went home with my old roommates, and we started to cook Venezuelan food. My roommates were tired, but they started to cook with my old roommates and me. We had fun. Finally, they like to do sports such as basketball, soccer, tennis and swimming. So that, evey night after school, we go to the Arby center in BYU.

Cities are depending of this balanace that countries have to develop these points. People might thinmk that cities are independent of the country becuase they could have different laws that would help them. In my opinion they cities are depending of of their country to grow, and important point for this is the police force because they would support the security and economy, which is important to student' and citicens' lifes.            I would oraganize a stronger police force throught my city. Puerto la Cruz is a university city where is located in the coast of Venezuela, so that there are many turist from other countries and form other cities in Venezuela. So that, this city is dangerous and insecure for student people such as me. This is a short-term improvment becuase there are prepared police that could help the security. For example, there are groups of polices that recieved a really hight preparation to manage difficulties. They are prepared physically and mentally prepared. They are called 'NCB police'. For this reasons they would help a lot to students that hang out often, and they would guarantee their life. For these reaoons I would make the police force stronger.              Puerto la Cruz would become more powerful economically if the police is stronger. This is a long-term fact, which means that it would take some year to achieve it. This city would become even more visited for people from around the world because in Puerto la Cruz is located a beach that has the clearest wather in South America. These beaches are called 'parguito and tumeremo' The police would help to make the city more secure for visitors and international people. In consecuence, more people would visit this place to visit turist places and for the security. This would create a great income of money because they would spend money in several atractive and beautiful places. This money would be used by the state to develop the city economy. This is would make students' economy stronger.              Poplice force is very important becuase they support the security and even the economy of the cities and countries. This is very important for the students that are people that are trying to grow. There are people that might think that there are more important things such as social support because it helps each other, but iy my opinion cities are depending of this police force to become bigger, stronger, and security to people living there such as students.",4.8W17 LATs,64431,"My sister  and I are living here together, that is something that never makes me feel alone.

However, one of the most important improvement where people should improve is Education's life. Taking advantage of time, responsibilities and good opportunities are three important aspects which allow young people to improve the Society by .First, taking advantage of time is when people organize their activities in order to be active and proactive. For example, there are a lot of campaings and activities created with an especific purpose, and also these activities have value for the curriculum vitae. Sometimes people use as an excuse their schedules because University is the primary responsibility. However, there are people that work and study at the same time. It is because they organize and have a plan every day, and thus they graduate. Therefore, is people take advantage of their time the excuses are not necessary.Second, responsibilities  mean when people respond by actions, but in time. Sometimes it is hard to take decisions because people is afraid to fail, so they decide to quit. Nevertheless this is the worst choice they could ever do because improving is result of constance, discipline and practice. Attending to the school, cleaning the house, getting a job are some responsiblities that young people may learn and become mature. Society may improve is people is conscient of their responsabilities and never wait until things are done. If people want to live in a good society, so they have to take the responsibility to keep improving every single day.Finally, good oportunities are the key to be successful because they give the experience to respond and be involved in different scopes. When people is young, they might not know what is the best thing to do or the best job to get. All the experience allow the people to get knowledge which makes the people smart, also experience  helps the people to realize which aspects people should analyze in before situations. There are professional people who have gotten different jobs before the one that they like the most and they are professional. People should learn by opportunities because all of them have benefits that help life in Society.In conclusion,  taking advantage of time, responsibilities and good opportunities are three important aspects that allow young people to improve their society  because they will benefit to the rest  in the future by Education's life.  Even though some homework apparently can disturb, the constance and discipline are good tools that young people are able to use in order to improve the place were they live.",4.81W17 LATs,82508,"In Ecuador I was living with my parents and my younger brother, All of them are people that I love.

She is a housewife. My brother is 23 years old, He served his mission in Colombia when he was in his mission he changed his life and when he return to Ecuador his relationship with me was better.   Now I can say my brother is one of my best friends. I really appreciate to live with my family.  They are incredible people for me. I miss them every day in my life.  Now days I value more my family than before. I know the families can be together forever and I am really happy for this knowledge that I have, it make me to stay in calm in this time.","One of the improvement that make my city a better place is the educational model. In the last years my city experiments an increase in the people who are studying that's why the goverment decided to create many new schools and high schools buildings. They change the way that the people learned, give more challenges for young people too. They do my city more active. The principal characteristics that change were: the infrastructure of the buildings, the method to teach, activities for students.First, I want to talk about the infrastructure of the buildings. The goverment decided to create new buildings for students. the students can be more motivated to learn and they are more happy, because they can be free and feel the country are interested in the future. They have more space to learn and practice sports. They have new computer labs. when I was a student all was different because I had to share a computer with two or more people, existed a lot of people in each high school. Now all of this is better, you can learn more fast.The second point is the method to teach. Years ago when I was a student the teacher had to be a professional for be a teacher, Now the situation changed, because If someone want to be a teacher, they have to give some exams and study more, be professional is not enough now need to has a master degree or a phd. The students have to be more creative and try to investigate, the students have to learn for themselves. Internet helps a lot in this situation.A lot of schools have begun new programs for the students like music classes or different sports. This kind of activities help to be concentrated to be better. Now days drugs are destroying our young people but with this kind of activities the goverment try to fight with this problem. This activities help people to be interested in other things. For example our country have a big soccer players around the world thanks to this kind of activities in the schools. In conclusion the goverment of my city are doing their well. We like citizens have to help and support this kind of changes in the educational system. We have to participated and try to help our young people becuase is the future of the country or more general, the future of the world. In my opinion I didn't have this kind of programs when I was a student but I think is really important and I am totally in accord with that. My country is a poor country but I think the goverment and the people are doing their well to be succesful in the future and finally be a real competitive country.",4.81W17 LATs,44278,"I would like to write about my family because I believe that the members of my family are very intelligent, smart, dangerous, and helpful. I highly respect them for these qualities, and I love them very much. My son could organized his own business, and his company is so successful. I remember how he tried to do his best in school, at university. He was always very responsible, honest, creative, and all his friends respected him. My son is very professional at his job and simultaneously he is a perfect husband and father in his own family. Also, I have a talented daughter, I love her very much.","There are various opinions about improvements in my city. People are very different, and they have their own tastes and opinions. From my point of view, it is better to do something with ecological situation in a huge city where more than five millions citizens live. I consider that the authorities in the city should think about dirty water and not fresh air, and it is very important to change water and air in more excellent qualities.Firstly, all people know that it is impossible to live without clean water. Dirty water can cause various serious diseases like cancer, blood illnesses, and headaches. The most important and very necessary for people's life thing is water. In my city people suffer from diseases when they drink dirty water. This water is from the river where plants and factories waste their gubbage. So, the authorities should pay attention on this problem and try to sove it.Secondly, people need to breath only fresh air, and it is a tremendous problem that needs  to be solved. There are a huge amount of cars, automobiles, trucks on the streets of my city. I think that the transportation is not controlled by authorities because the air is not fresh, and sometimes it smells badly. In addition, all kinds of enterprises add their fumes to the air. The authorities should do something with this problem and as soon as possible.In conclusion,  fresh air and clean water are the most important things in our life. All people want to be healthy and happy, and it is the responsibility of our authority to solve the problems of dirty water and poisoned air. Maybe, it needs time and efforts, but it is the most important task that we need to solve. I hope that we with our authorities can do it in order all peole be very happy and healt",4.81F15 LATs,79305,"When I was in my counrty, I was living with my family. I have parents and three little sisters. Their personalitires differ from one to another, but it was funny to live with them.   My parents work from morning to evening every day except Sundays. My mother cooks breakfast every morning for us. My father often works until the late night. My mother's personality is interesting because she is basically calm and kind, but if she is tired, she usually becomes offentive. My father's personality is always calm, and he rarely gets mad, which I respect.   My three sisters are students. My first sister goes to high school, and she is charge of volley ball club in her high school. She also studies hard, so her life is pretty busy. My second sister goes to junior high school. She has to take an important exam in order to go to high school in next spring, so she only studies hard for the exam. My third sister goes to junior high school and joins basket ball club.","My city is not urban, but it is not rural. Currently, there is no specific and huge problems in my city; however, in the next 50 years, some problems, such as an aging society and a lack of jobs, might occur. To improve my city and continue to be prepoteous, branch stores of many huge companies should be built and take care of other companies in my city comsidering two elemetns in my city: average age of the population and small comapnies in my city.   First, introducing many huge companies will lead many young people to come to my city in the future. The avarage age of the population getting higher in my city, which will be a huge problem in the future and cause an aging society. However, if many huge companies take a role in my city, even young people can easily find their jobs, and they will not need to go to huge cities to find jobs. Also, huge companies have a power to make people stay in the area. For instance, several huge companies have built their branch stores in my city this year. Consequently, the stores need people who work for them, and many people from various generations try to move to my city because the city has huge companies' stores. Therefore, people will stay in my city if huge companies will be introduced.   Second, the types of my city have been urban. This year, the main station in my city has been rebuilt because of one remarkable event, and my city is now famous and popular for people in my country and even in foreign coutries. By rebuilting the station, the scene has changed, and it looks urban. Small companies still play important roles in my city. However, if huge companies take care of the small companies, the small companies will be able to improve more by supports from huge companies and catch up with the change of my city. If huge companies do not take care of them, they might be faded away because of the change in my city. Hence, small comapnies will be able to be more successful if huge companies will be introduced.   Two problems: avarage age of the population and small companies in my city will have been solved by introducing huge companies. Huge companies have a power to let people stay in my city. Small companies will be supported by huge companies in order to maintain their businesses. In conclusion, in the future, my city will be more preposteous even though it now seems to have no problems.",4.81W17 LATs,03214,"I am living in Alpine Village with three roommates now, two of them is from USA and one of them is from Peru.

Her personality is kind of wired because she never talk with them and always bring her boyfriend to our apartment. The second roommates her name is Dinna also from USA, she is our new roommates with her cat. She is now study in UVU, we didn't talk with each other a lot, so I am not sure what is her interest.

And my city is Hong Kong, a lot of people know that Hong Kong is the most expersive place for living in the world. So I think if identify one improvement make my city better place to live it should be the cost.       Firstly, have a house or living in Hong Kong is really hard now whatever for adult or teenages. In Hong Kong if we don't have enough money for living, then they will find the worst place for living such as the really dirty place or dangerous place. So if the goverment can bulid more houses or give them aid it will have a better place to live for lots of people.      Secondly, becuase of the expersive cost we cannot get married to live with the family. In Hong Kong if we want to live with them we need to move a large house or new house this is our trandition, but a lot of people  because of the living cost cause they cannot live with them, and finally they have a bad relationship. So if the goverment can give us a low cost for living it will be help for our relationship and make us feel less stress about living and family.   Finally, in Hong Kong we have a lot of teenages and adult because of living they decide to die. Becacuse we have different houses for different salary people, some people they are in poor level so they need to live in the public house. But if you living in the public house you cannot choose whicg area that you want, so because of this reason a lot of people in my age they will  choose to die, let the goverment know more about the living problem.   In conclusion, I think one improvement for living in my city, it will be the cost. Because is really terrible and expersive, living cost in Hong Kong it can cause a lot of serious problem to the people. So if we can improve that then I think we will have a good enviroment and feel less stress.",4.82W17 LATs,89324,"I like to live with my roomates, because they are lovable, nice, and full of faith. I am living in Provo at Raintree. I live with five other girls. My roommate is from Idaho. She is shorther then me and she has brown hair as me. I have a roommate who is from Hungary too. She is a very nice girl. I did not know before a couple mounths ago. She like to listen music and we spend a lot of time together. My other four roommates are nice too. One of them from Brazil and she speaks diffrently then others. The Brazilian girl is really short and she has black hair. In our appartment we always have good time together. We care form each other and we help everyone to fell comfortable in the apartment. The SWe pray together and we go to church together. Two of my roommates are work together one of the is the Hungarian. They like to work together.  The Hungarian girl is studying with me at the ELC. I really like my roomates and I am glad I can share appartment with them.","Everywhere on earth, in every county has things that we can thing of to change. Hungary has too. The biggest problem in Hungary is the education, and the opportunities to have a good job because  young adults are leave the county to have better life in a different country. My oppinion is not bad when young adults are decide to go and find a better jobs in different counties. To imporove a county is hard but possible if everybody works together.     First thing that Hungary could change to imporve the county is to give more opportunities for the young people to study and have a good education. I think the first reason why young people don't have good education is the money. Parents are cannot support their children to have a good education because to go to collgage is a lot of money. Therefore after highschool young adults use to go to work if they have any opportunities. Sometimes young adults can have opportunities to go forward and study more because their grates are great, but when this is not the case they cannot choose to study more. Sometimes people are help, and support young men to be an exchange studnet and study in a different counry. To improve the education system in Hungary is sound difficult, and seems difficult but I hope on day my country can education system can grow like the U.S. education system does.    The second thing that Hungary could improve is the opportunities to have better job for the people. This is a real and sad fact in Hungary that the country cannot support the people to have great opportunities to have a good job. Infact sometimes young people want to find job but they cannot because there is no any chance to get jobs. Mostly young adults decide to make their life better so they move in a different county.This is  not the best for the economy system in Hungary because those young adults are the future for HUngary and for the economy system , therefore if they leave the county they build the 'economy future' in a different county. I think that is not bad when young people are try to have a better life in a different county because on time might they go back with all of their experiences to their home contry and they can bulid their county and give knowledge how to imporve the country.    The fact to imporve a country in eveywhere on earth a big problem. Two things can make a county better are the give opportunities to steducation",4.82F15 LATs,47067,"I've been living with my new roommates since september 2,2015.

In the first bedroom in the apartment , there are two roommates from San Antonio ,Texas. They both speak spanish with each other because one of them is from Puerto Rico , and the other one is from Mexico .Second, in the second bedroom, there are two roommates who are from the same town in Riverton, Utah. They had been living in the same town when they were kid until now. Finally, my last room who lives with me is from North Carolina.

The government of my Island don't know how to make this city a good place to live for people who wants to go forward in their lifes .This is the biggest city in the island ,but the most basic problem in the city is about education, finance and smoking and drinking policy.       The most important thing the the government should change first in the city is about the education that they give. The main reason that the government is having trouble to the figure out how to make all the students with the same age with me is because many students quit high school at the age of 18. The government do not encourage those students who quit high school early is because the teachers that they paid to teach us don't know how to teach about a subject or a skill. Furthermore, the government should not let the teachers hit their students in High school because they are not the parents of these student. The consequence of the act can make those teachers lose their job and get kick out of the school .Those teachers should talk to their students because their student have the potetial to move forward in their life or show their parents that they are smart.     Second, the most important thing that the government shoud take care of is about the financial problems for the students in High school. The government should help these students to paid for their financial problems such as for the books and the materials needed. If the government help those students with these problems, the students will keep studying in the same High school untill they graduate from the high school. This will be a good act of kindness if the government help these students to finish their education. I suggest if hte govenment keep help these study, they will improve the education.     Finally, the most most important thing that the government should chanhe is about the smoking and drinking policy. The government should care about the health of the students who are studying in high school because smoking and drinking alcohol can be harmful for some students. If they chanege the age for smoking and drinking, it will helpful for the parents and for the studnets",4.82F15 LATs,03719,"I did not have roommates before I came here.  I lived with my family in my country. It is really different to live with family than with roommates. I lived with my parents and my 3 little siblings. It was really fun , and we were able to spend a lot of time together.  My little siblings are really fun but there were times when , it was really hard to be able to focus in my studies because they wanted me to play with them all the time. My litlle sister always wanted to go out and play with our dog , and when I did not have time, she was really sad, so she went out and showed me our dog trought the window in order to make me go out and play with her. My other two siblings and teenagers and it was really funny to hear all of their stories about how they think the school  is a crazy place. For these reasons it was really hard to focus in my studies when I was at home. My parents ussually wanted to spend a lot of time as a family so we were always planing vacations and trying to adjust our schedules with it. I loved the time I lived with them, But I think it is better for my studies to be focus and live by myself, and during break go to my house and spend time with them.","One improvement that would make my city better, would be to not allow the city to have so many bars and to restrict students in the hours they have acces to it. Students are used to going to bars or pubs after the classes and that represent a big damage in their life, not only for students but also for the city. If we reduce the amount of bars and pubs and the accesibility  , we would be avoiding other problems such as : delincuence, accidents, fights in the streets and it would be helping  students to perform in a better way at school.First, students usually are tired and want to do something different after class, that is why most of the time they go to the bars and pubs after classes. Which represent an increasing damage for them and the society. If less pubs are allowed in the city , it will make the students to go to another place and do something more productive. Probably we will not be able to see the consequences inmediatly but in a long term it will represent an important change for the city and the students because they will choose another place to go making more effective their lifes or at least not a problem for the city. Second, in a long term it is going to be able to afect the city in an effective way, because, the accidents and violence in the streets are going to decrase. Bars and pubs are one of the reason of several accidents during the night time in the city. most of them are cause by sudents that have been consuming drugs or alcohool after their classes. If we decreased the ammount of pubs and the accesibility to them, it would help to the police to control this problems in a more effective way. Also it will protect the cithizens and the student to suffer accidents and crimes. In conlusion, reducing the ammount of pubs and bars in the city and also specific to restrict students to go to them. Will represent an important change in the city and it will decrease the number of accidents and violence. If these places are not available, students are going to have to choose another places to go and it will increase in a long term the security of the city.

When my brother figured out what was happening with me, he explained me that always there is a way to solve the problems. He took me out of home, and we have a fun time this day.

Where people want everything soon and easy. Young people are influenced by TV shows, movies, music, and celebrities. For all these inflences sources young people are spending more time having fun than having knowledge, or learning from academic sources as books. That is why more libraries in the city would be a very good way to help young people to spend more time learning by reading academic books, and at the same time help them to save money in this practice.              More libraries will allow to young people to be abe to spend more time reading books  and learning. Libraries have many items that probably young people would like to read, but not always they these books are availables for everyone. When these kind of situations happen, many young people find other ways to spend their time, for exmalpe playing video games, having fun wuth friends, or just wasting time watching TV shows. If young people have access to more books they will learn more by spendng time reading.             If more libraries are avilables, young people will be able to save money by cheking out books that they would like to read, instead buying them. Today, all young people are student. Consequently, they do not have money or probably they have a few money in their pockets. Young students are more likely to spend their money in funny things or entertament. For instance, students like going to play video games, going shopping, buying accesories, or going to spend money in fast food restaurants. They do not want to  spend money in books, or cultural thing so that is imperative that goverment allow to young people more access to cultural and academic book for free.             In order to help the future of our city, or in other word youn people of our country, goverment and other institutions have the duty to provide more knowledge and more learning by rising more libraries in the city.

Some things have to change in benefit with this new generation , and see areal progress in special our country. Many changes are property, but two of them they are very neccesary education and virtues. they are really neccesary and work together to see a good solution and change in people of my age.tHe first reason is  education , with a high quality in this aspect we can have more opportunities to find a good job. Even though this is a thing that always is watching how it can improve , but without any results. At the same time if we want a good city or place to live we should focus in that. Education is not only received good teachings , but we should take conscience  about how we are receiving it. It is critical problem because is a remarkable problem that we  inmediately take a solution. we will see true changes not only in this generation , but with the future too.  Many opporutnities could have our country and nobody has to out to find a good knolegde in anotehr country.The second thing is the true importance  in virtues. Even though that  is soemtimes isa thing that we do not take a real importance , but it is a big problem that is growing every time. These times people is very cold and we see many problems that all begings with personality or vitues. We should notice that is really important and benefit for us in every aspect of our lives. If the new generation learn about that they become more sensitive with the person of around them and realize that be a man with virtue is more value taht have more money. For that before learn how we can have more success we   should learn how we can preserve  or increase our virtues.In conclusion,  this new changes are very great for this people  because little by little we are becoming a cold and empty people that only think in gain more more money. Therefore we should think in the things are real improtance or value. with a good education we will notice that people can be more prepared to face any struggles in their life and our country potential will increase.

There are three thing that my city can do for better the oportunities for young people.                         First is giving more preparation for the future personal that will work in the company. This will help because in my city there is not much work or there is not much people preparation for this type of work. I beleive that this can be a good advice for this city because the economy will be able to do better. Second, give more education in school and higschool this will help the future generation of young. Because everyone will have more preparation than before. It is a good point for start and each person will be better with their jobs. Also they will make money because they will be very preparation. In conclussion this will help all of the young people in this city.                         Another thing that can help is make more companies that can help the economy of each person and especial to the country. there two forms of the country can help. One is making more laws that help a new companies to do more big. Because this way can help to young people to find a job these is very important that there manny oportunities.

Moreover, we went to hikeing or snowboarding. They are very nice people. They always give me a ride when I want to go on shopping. They help me a lot to improve my English skills.

Most of my age they are working and they do not have a car, so transportation is very important for them, so they should deserve a good trasportation for two reasons: they can save time, and they feel better going to work.To begin with, they do not waste their time to wait transpotation for a long time. Transpotation in Thailand is not good enough for people because it has not provide a schedule time for people yet, so people have to wait a bus unit it come. On the other hand, if people can check the bus schedule, they can save and manage their time. For example, I had been working at Siam Kubota, which is Japanese compary for two years, I had to wait a bus around 30 minuts every day. Sometimes, I could take bus early and got the office early around 15 minuts, but sometimes I got the office very late because the bus came late. I cound not manage my time and I also could not save my time to do other things such as study. In summary, Improving transportation in my age is important to people because they can save their time. Second, people will feel better and happy before they are going to work  if transportation is improving. People always get mad or unhappy when they almost are late to work because a bus comes late. They will feel nervous and bad to be late. Furthermore, they are afraid that their boss will get angry. Those feelings are not good for employees because they should feel good and ready to work that they will be able to do very good job. To illustrate this point, in my story, I always felt bad when I was late because my boss was very stick and I did not want them feel disappointed about me. As the result, I had to wake up early to take a bus. As you can see, transpotation should be improved for people in my generation who are working. In conclusion, transportation, especially a bus, is one of improvement that my conutry should take care about it. Not only can people save their time, but also people feel good and fresh to working.  Transportation should improve for working people as my age.

One of the important aspect to improve in a city is the transportation system. In Bogota, many people think that having more malls, industries, and buldings is better than improving the transportation system. However, improving the transportation sytem such as roads and metros, those can bring many benefits for all the citizens of Bogota such as making distances shorter and saving time.Bogota in the capital of Colombia, which is the biggest city in the country, people take long time moving aorund the city. Many people like to visit different place in the city, but sometimes they do not  becuase those are far away from their houses due to there are not free ways or big avenues to travel. Free ways are big road, which facilitade people to travel faster than other roads of the city. For instance, if there were one free way from North to South, and another from East to West, those will be a great benefit making distances shorter.The other improment will be having a metro system. Metros can carry as many people than other services on, and metros have their own roads to go faster than cars or other transportation services. Having  a metro in Bogota can benefit many students and workers. It will save time to them in several situationes on their daily lives. Although, many students do not have cars to move into the city; they will use the metro. Furthermore, with multiple metros into the city, many people will be happy becuase the can travel faster and save time in their days.Becuase making distances shorter and saving time is important to Bogota's citizens. Building new roads such as free ways and implementing metros into the city are good improments for the city. If Bogota implemets these improments, many people will live happier and not stress about the crow road that today Bogota has. Also, multiple could have extra free time to do other things, saving time with faster services of transportation such as metros.",4.84W17 LATs,11598,"Living  apart from my family is the hardest thing in my life.Every time i miss them ,and even i life with my grandfathers here  , live with my siblings was a beatiful experience .

This had like consequence, that a lot of people from others countries like Colombia or Cuba decided that Ecuador was a better place for lived .After years the goverment has been realized that all this migration had a serios effect in our economy .But why , is because now all the colombians or cubans come to Ecuador and they decide to made the work for half of the salary so the companies prefer them.So when you aplied for a job the managers prefer to hired them , leaving ecuadorians without opportunities.                Years ago had a bachelor degree in Ecuador was a big deal , now most of the people who get a bachelor degree in my own country end working in something really different form what they studied.University preparation in the past was only for the ones who can afford , now is the different the goverment is giving students the opportunity to enter into a colllege without thinking that a lot of the carrers had a lot proffesionals, and that we dont had all that vacants avaible .This is one of the most controversial points in Ecuador and now a lot of youngest people that graduate from high school prefer to came to the United States to studied .They realized that having a bachelor degree from here open a lot a of opportunities in all the world.                        Is also funny see how you went to interviews for getting  a job and how they asking you for experience, is weird because if no one hired you how can you ,get this experience.Another problems is that just having a bachelor degree is not enough you need a master , is hard had all this education when you only had 24 years old.You always heard from the goverment that we are the future of our country.One of the solution ton this problem could be that we made some requirements to the companies that when they made the interviews they hired in 100 % , 98 ecuadorians and the other 2% people form other countries, this could bring a lot of beneficts to ecuador and also their econmoy.                       In conclusion I believe as the youngest people whe need to fight for our dreams, if we had the opportunity to go to another country and get our bachelor degree we need to take advantage from this.Neverthless we need to come back to our country and serve there became into a instrument and tried to made the change.Persuade all our dreams and dont let the society or the goverment determinted in whta we should work.Work hardest and tried to change the goverment , and also companies opinion and made Ecuador just one country without division , prefer first people from our country.And buk",4.85F15 LATs,11301,"Living alone is really different from now than the past.

It can be really stressful for students that they want to study a specific manner but the unversity is already full or far away from their home. The government should open new universities around my city and garantize the future of the students.     New universities will give more opportunities for students. A lot of students are not confortable with what thet are studying or other students study something only because they can't find what they want to study or only because they want to stay with their friends. This is a huge problem for the soicity because is not student's fault. Opening new unversities will help every student to be sure with what they want to study. They will be confident because they will have a lot of choises. Students have to learn the things they like because if not, they will suffer of depresion and they will have a lot of problem. Also, they have to learn with good teachers that they can understand everything and see if the career is aceptable for them. Another reason will be students can stay in their city without travelling far away from their home. A lot of students spend a lot of money because they a have to wake up really early and take the train or the bus to get really far away from their home. Some of them get sick or don't have enough time to study or to sleep because they spend hours and hours in the train.

Also students have to be proud of what they are studying. They will work for the rest of their life so for this reason a good university is important.     To conclude, it will be a greatful benefit for the students to have differents universities for having more choice for the career, for not traveling far away and loose a lot of time and to be proud of what people are studying.",4.85W17 LATs,10276,"A few months ago, I was living in Brazil with my family.

My brother, different from my parents, does not work. He studies at the medical university in my city and studies all day long. My father is a bank teller and my mother is an English teacher. The most interesting thing about my parents is that they are very different. My father is very pacient and calm; on the other hand, my mother is not pacient at all and always with a lot of energy.

However, in my city, it is very hard to find a place where people can practice their skills, specially with music. There are not many places where people can have access to different instruments or people to teach them. Stated that, one beneficial way which would make my city better is building a place for people to learn how to play instruments. The first reason to build this place is because it will bring several benefits for young people. There are many studies that support the idea that studying a new instrument will have the capacity to improve people's brains. For example, it is a fact that anything that people learn can have several benefits, and learning an instrument if not different. People will be capable of being a better multitasker and will concentrate better. Additionally, it can help people to see the world differently. Music can change people's lives and learning how to play an instrument in order to practice music, will help them to improve them as a person.The second reason is that nowadays it is very easy to find people willing to play an instrument. As stated previously, playing an instrument bring a lot of benefits, which make people have the desire to play them. However, it is very hard to find a place to learn them, and for this reason, building a place to teach people will result in a great amount of people willing to learn. Furthermore, it will atract young people to that place and they will have the opportunity of improving their skills and enjoy playing it.The third and last reason is that it is enjoyable to play an instrument. Since ancient times, people admire music independent in the period of time they live. For example, two centuries ago people enjoyed a lot classical music and people would come to concerts to listen to them. Even though people nowadays do not enjoy classical music as before, people are still looking for ways to learn an instrument. This happens because playing them is fun and enjoyable. People feel good while playing an instrument and it awakens their creativity.In conclusion, building a place in order to teach people how to play an instrument will help them a lot to develop their brains, it will atract many people to play, and it is enjoyable. For these three reasons people should also consider the idea of building a place like this. People will find a way to improve them as people. Also, music open doors and people who play it will aquire the multiple benefits that comes with it.",4.86F15 LATs,48769,"I used to live with an American family, they were always so nice with me they woke up in the morning did exercise and had breakfast, they always shared with me in the mornuings a drink made with several fruits in order to have energy during they day, after that they mande sevaral activities. For example, they helped their daugthers to move from thwir old apartment so they asked me if i wabted to help them to do that and i said yes, we had a really good time. Another time i went to downtown with them to the place where one of their daughters work at and we went to buy a shake in the mall and buy some other things.On weekends we used to go to church in the morning, then come back to the house and have dinner with the whole family, after that we went to practice the choir with some other families around and then we came back to the hopuse and watch a movie.","Better public transportation should be implemented in my city because where i live there is an increasing number of students every year and public transportation is very poor here. Since there are to universities close to here there are many students that do not have a car. Therefore, they have to take the bus to go to college or to do some other activities. However, if they do not want to miss a class or want to be on time to a certain meerting or activitie they have to be careful about the time when the bus come because they do not run very often.  For example if a student missed the bus they have to wait for at least 15 to 20 minutes when the next bus comes, or if they want to travel to a different city and they miss the train, they will have to wait for an hour, which makes imposible to be on time once they missed the first train.Some of the benefits that it would bring to society is the flexibility of the schedule of the buses and trains that would make transportaion easy for students. In addition student would prefer to take the public transportation because it would be cheaper and convinient for them, whic would be an advantage because the usage or cars would decrease, therefore; levels of pollution would decrease too.By improving public transportation students performance would improve too because student who do not have a car would me able to move from one part to another faster. Thus attendignas many appointments they have or doing all the activities they have to do in less time.In conlcusion, public transportation is important and even more important in a city like mine whre there are many students because many time they cannot do all the things they want because of the poor service that is provided now.",4.86S17 Placement,41567,"I just move here 4 days ago, so I lived with my family 17 years of my life.

I love my city but it needs urgently a little bit of order, people of my age right now are not the same of the last generations, we are having too many obstacles in our lifes, and I will give specific examples of that.The first reason is that the cops in my city are very corrupt, you can buy them so easily, nowadays too many teenagers are in drugs or pregnant and that is beacuse there isn't a restriction for them to buy durgs or alcohol or to enter to a motel, if we let them to do this kind of things that aren't good even for adults what can we expect that teenagers won't do it.Another reason is that the goverment doesn't worry about our education, sadly in my country if you don't have enough money to be in a private school you won't be able to have a good education. Most of the people from small cities or poor sides of my country and city don't have even a school near their houses, and if the parents didn't have a good education eighter, they will never encourage their own children to go to the school. The president and goverment need to focus in what is more important for the next generations in our country.The last reason but not less important is that in my city most of the people can't find a good job even with a profession, the normal profit for a peruvian is 800 soles that in dollars is around 250, with we can barely mantain ourselves, this make people to travel abroad looking for more opportunities, but even to travel we need money and visa that is also hard to find. We need opportunities in our own country, in our city, we need to be able to have a family and live in calm.If we continue like this our country is going to break, we need to do something for poor people right now, we need to build more schools everywhere and with a good structure for children, we need to make a diference for the next generations if we want a succesful city, we have a lot of potencial that that we doesn't know how to control, we can have more teenagers working and studying than in drugs if we do something for them.",4.87F15 LATs,15804,"One of my roommates her name is Kim.

This is a main problem for people around 18 to 26 years old. The best way to help or fix this issue is the goverment to provide more scholarships for people whom wants to study or get a higher degreen. Scholarship can help students love school more and withouth worries, and it can help students want to become a good model to others and help them to understand the improtant of schooling. First, scholarship can help people focus on study and do not need to worry about money. For exmaple, tuition is very expensive for most students, students need to spend time to work more than 25 hours to earn meony to support them self to keep living and schooling. Studnets have many fee need to pay each month, such as: rent, insurance, food, gas, books etc. Those fees are a burden for students. If the goverment can provide more scholarships for students, students do not need to work too long to support them self, they will have more time to study, it helps them to do well on tests, get a better scores and enjoy their student's life. Scholarships can help students become a happy and hard working student.Scholarship can motivate people want to study and help them understand the improtant of education. When people know that they can get scholarship from the goverment, they will think about why they need to go to scool, why the goverment will provide scholarship for them, and  what are the reasons behind for the scholarship. People will think more deeply and want to find the answer. When people know that education is very improtant for them, it can change their lifes. They want to go to school and study more. On the other hand, they know that if they go to school, they can get scholarship from the goverment, they will try harder and study harder to get in to schools. Also, when those hard working students around theri friends, it helps their friends understand the improtant of school, they will want to become like them too, they will study hard as them. Because of this, scholarship can has a good influent for the students and the society. It can studnets to be motivited and be passion about school.In conclusion, one of the best ways to help Macau's goverment to improve is to provide more scholarship to students. It can hlep students easy to focus on school without worries. Also, it can make students have a better understand about the vaule of edecation. It can help students have a disire to get higher edcuation and become a good example to other people.",4.88F15 LATs,87638,"During this semester I was living with roomates, with one of them I have a good relationship.

In Montevideo should be more universities and carrear options. For many years, people was and is traveling arround the country, arround many countries in south America, and there are some who travel to countries such as, Italy, United States, or inclusive Canada to find a better education and future for their lives. There are two main reasons because in my city should be more universities and carrear options the country could grow and people would be more able to get better positions in their jobs than is now.First of all, Uruguay would have more posibilities to grow. Education is essential in our lives, the problem in Montevideo is that we do not have multiple options of carrears, so for that reason people prefer to travel and study aboard in another country to have more oportunities and options of education. The fact that people is studying aboard is having an impact in Uruguay because we are losing people with good skills and habilities that could be a good instrument there. If in Uruguay we had more institutions and carrear options, the country could have many people with good skills and habilities to change the situation that we have right now.Secondly, work positions are very important today to be able to support your family. Having a good position in your work area could give you an extra support for your family giving them a free health care, a good salary, and othey many bennefits that are important. However, not all of the people have access to these beneffits because of the education that they have. Those who have these beneffits is because they have studied in other country or in a really expensive University in Uruguay. Even dough many people have studied hard, there are some who do not have the oportunity to get good position works. In conclusion, if the education system in Uruguay take some changes, it could grow and people could be able to get better positions in their jobs.

Sometimes, in my city, I want to go to the park with my dog, but I do not have options to enjoy my free time. My city does not have special spaces to play sports or just walk around. In my opinion, it is a problem, because it is important to do exercises everyday. When we do physical exercises, we can improve our health and we can be more happy. I think that everyone needs to do exercies at least three times each week.                        My city needs more spaces to do outdoor activities, because is important enjoying the nature. Enjoying the nature, listening the music of birds, watching the sunset, and breathing pure air are the best things to do during the outdoor activities.

According with the government reports, one cellphone has stolen each minute.  One good change that could help everyone is be aware with each other about our belongs. Keep in our mind that we are more good people than bad people. Last 5 years the major created many advertaisment about culture, do not be rude.  People rethink about their behavior. We started to think in others such as neighbors, bus drivers, policeman, and everyone. We started to be humans. However, politics changed every 4 years as a consequence we lost this good job.  Bogota could be a better place when we never give up our projects of culture change from the former majors. First of all, help others to be alert of their belongs is the security key. If we are aware that we can help other with a protest against robbers, we can get that robbers feel afraid of stole other. For example, citizens in The United States call the police when they find that someone is doing something wrong. This protect culture is a good example to learn in Bogota. When we help others with our eyes and be alert of our own belongs. We cut down this problem very fast than we can image.Second, reject bad behaviors and be police. When society accepts certain behavior, society permits that others violent their rights. We should reject any bad behaviors that we see on the bus, on the street. When we are quiet, and we avoid the situation of someone in risks. We only are selfish, we are thinking in our own benefits. We do not care if the other could kill someone for money or belongs.  For example, American culture allows that citizens could be police and they have guns for some emergencies. It is consider defense. We should act together like a family to defend other,To sum up, people make a better place with attitude and behavior.

Also, we have some problem, people always waste food or a lot of sources. And, recycling is the most important things in this world. Because of all the world have the same problem. We have a policy about recycling, but we must immeditaly do it. Indeed, we have rules about recycle, but people do not care about this. Especially, they waste a lot of things and lazy. To improve recycling policy is very important and common in this world, so we must care anout this world, if we want to live here. Also, we have three ways to improve our policy. One is improving laws, make them powerful. Second is starting near our enviroment. Three is getting a lot of information about the world.The first way is improving our laws, sometimes we do not care about the laws because the laws are not too strong to limite people to do somethings. For example, some of country have a rule that is we must do correctly recycling, if we do not do it correct or put it wrong, we must pay a lot of money. But, if we put wrong in my country, nobody notice this. If people see this, nobody will say nothing because the laws are very difficult and if we want to start fight with anothe people, you must be very rich or strong. Everyone wants to be peaceful, nobody want to start the fight. Also, people do not understand what is improportant to do recycling. If we can improve our laws, for example, we can make a law about if we threw away recycling, we must threw correctly, if we do it wrong we must pay a lot of money, but if somebody see this, they can report you, and get a lot of money. This way can improve the law, and notice each other at the same time.The second way is starting near our enviroment, because all the time, we can force someone do it right, but we can not make sure, we always do the correct things. That is very difficult, but if we want to improve our enviroment or protect the earth, we must start from ourselves, not another people that you do not know. Because if we can do it from ourselves, when someone see, they will think and maybe they do it the same things. For example, when we see a lot of trash in the ground, we can go to clean and pick it up, threw aways to trash cane or recycle cane, when people see you, and you are doing this, that will effect people to do the same things. So, that is very important to do it to yourself from the begining. The third way is getting a lot of information about recycling, because we need to know the reason why we must protect the earth or doing recycling. Indeed, we have a lot of ways and informatin on the website, people will read ,  but nobody will do it. It is diifficult to make it work. In addition, the goverment have a progrm about how we can reduce the earth pressure, also they will teach us in the school. And, we already know, they repeated and repeated. But, the important things is we have to do it, not just listening and do not do it. That is wasyte out time to teach this. Not only just read, we must stand up and do it. In addtion, we can search about a lot of things and take notes, when we have time, we can start from the first one that pick up all the trash when you see. Searching about why we must do this, and we have to do it, when we know about the reason or notice about this problems are very seriously, we will do it.Above of all, we need to improve our recycling policy to make our country becmoeb a beautiful country again. The must important things is this policy starting from all of the wro. And, every one notice those rules.  In",4.92F15 LATs,71936,"I have 5 wonderful roommates right now.

Especially, well developed transportaion systems are the crucial for most urban cities. Although some people move to rural country expecting to have peaceful life, it is really unconvenient to live with a few public transportation options. Having diverse transportation options is very important to make a city as a ideal place to live because when people are able to move arround the city efficiently, they can work better as well as spend their pastime with much more options. First of all,  there is a reseach that when a person's home is far from his or her work, they feel more stress and less satisfied with the job. That means the distance between the works and houses are closely related with humans' satisfaction of their life. It also can be applied students. For example, many students who live in 1 hour distance from their school, often complain about their hard life during the semester. They have to hurry every moring while the other students can relax. Therefore, considering the convenient public transportation is one of the most important part to make a city a better place. Secondly, when people have well developed transportation systems, they can have choose to spend their time outside. Because they can easily travel arround the city by taking subway, bus, or train,  they have more options to enjoy their pastime outside instead of being at home. From my experience, it was not easy to go shopping or hanging out with friends because my home was pretty  isolated from the down town. It made me sad sometimes. In conclusion, better transportaion systems make cities better places to live especiall for young generation people because it offers more chances to enjoy their free time and convenients ways to go to work. If people live in a small town without having good public transportation, they won't be able to f",4.92F15 LATs,35148,Pilar is my roomate. She is a wonderful person.

In her free time she do her visiting teaching assignment. When she is on vacation she would travel to CHiclayo or Trujillo to visit with her family. She has a friend that lives close to the house and her name is Trinidad. Trinidad is one of the best person that she enjoy to visit because she is a very spiritual person and loves to talk about her trials on the past and how she overcome them. She counsel her and encouraged her to improved her life. She cousel her to set goals and persevere even though there will be many obstacles in life. She said to her that she must never give up and that when she is having difficulties she must pray and fast and always keep the faith in God.

Transportation in my city is terrible, specially in the morning between 8am and 10 am and in the afternoon between 5pm and 8 pm. The other problem we have is that at this time when everybody are runing to work or to school is that the buses are full of people and we can't do any thing to stop this behavior. Transportation is a big problem in my city and there are some solutions that can be done.First since there is a problem with specific times during the day. I think that if the buses can have a specific location time where they can stop that will help people to know with anticipation so they would have time to prepare and be on the bus stop at the rigth time. I will also think that if we have bigger buses where everybody can be seated it will help because many people actually are traveling standing up on every bus. Specific location and bigger buses will help to improve the transportation problem in my city.I also think that if we can have a train or trax like we have in Utah it can help us to improve the quality of life of many people. Rigth now there are many people that has to expend so much time traveling in the bus and with the traffic make the problem worse. A trax is bigger then a bus and run even faster than a bus. I really think that to make this changes will help us to improve the quality of life of many peole. They woll be able to spend more time with their family and exercise. It is crucial that this can improvments can be done as soon as posible for the peopple and for the country.",4.93W16 Placement,37837,"I have tree roometes, their names are Paco, Pedro and Spencer, they are for latinmaerica, they are return missionarys, and  now they are learnig englis as well because they want to enroll in a byu program.

One of the biggest problems that we have is the public transportation, we need more bus stations, more avialblilty of subway stops, there are like 2 or 3 areas where all companies are located, so that makes that at 9 am all people want to get to ther jobs at the same time, for that reason I want to propuse thar companies can appy home office for all their workers as they can, it could help because the traffic would be less, the freeways and principal streets would have less people in. Another improvement to do in Mexico City is to take off the airport in the center of the city, it causes a lot of contamination and there isnt way to do bigger the airport because theres not space to do it, so if they take it off, and rebuild a new one away from all the city they can have a better one and they can offer more jobs and maybe the tourism can grow.The educational topic is one of the most important things to talk, we dont have a lot of Universities there, we just have 2 ones that are provided for the goverment, but the demand is to high, they just have 60,000 new places every year, but the demand is more than 1 million, so a lot of people needs to take a few years to be enrolled in a program. There are some moro options, there are some  private schools but in almost all cases they are too expensive, and there isnt a lot of scholarships opportunities, for that I propuse that people with possibilities should invest in mexican education, we are smart people and we really want have more opportunities. The long-terms consequences of that, will be that people can have better jobs, and international companies ll come to take mexican talent.",4.94F15 LATs,73386,"My roomates are all American.

Nowadays, more and more young people have moved in cities for a better living condition. A city that I live is called Taichung which does not have the subway. If Taichung had subway, it would bring some benefits to people at my age such as saving time and saving more money.If the city that I live had subway, it would save major of time for young people. For instant, Taichung has massive number of buses that people can use to go to work or visit other places. However, it is not very convenicence to people at my age because buses' speed are too slow. Subways' speed are faster than buses' speed becuase there are no traffic signs for subways. For this reason, subways can shorten the travel time for people at my age. They can use the time that they have saved to do other important things. Second, subways can help people at my age to save more moeny. For example, subways can take us to variety places that means young people do not need to buy cars which cost them a lot of money. Taipei city is the city with the subway transport system. People at my age who leave in that city usually do not have cars becuase they can take subways to go everywhere as they want. To sum up, subways is good for young people to save more moeny to buy other things.In conclusion, If Taichung could change anything, it would be better to have subway system because it can save time and money. People at my age would like to have subway system in Taichung city for it can save their time. Moreover, if taichung city had subway, people at my age could save more money. It is better to have subway system in my city for it can change people who are at my age's lives.",4.95F15 LATs,62610,"Curently I live with the senior couple.

There are a lot of programs and activities that happen in the city that are oriented on the youth. There is the problem in the employment that exsists. Young people graduate from the Universities and try to find a well-payed job. But all of the employees want to except only experienced workers and are not interested in the graduates. Providing the internship for the students would be a great solution for this problem because: students would chose their place of work before graduating, young people would have more choices of where to work and it would be a great motivation to improve the grades while stadying.First of all, students would be able to set some goals of where they want to end up working. That means that they would be studying the policies of the companies and would analize where they would be the most useful. It would benefin the students and the uture employees.  The companies would be able to choose from the best graduates who want to fit in to their company. That means they would be well prepared and would have willingness to work hard.Secondly, young people can work in different places wihile studying. That would give them experience which all of the companies require and, at the same time, they would be able to see what place would be the most beneficial for them. It educates the young people also. They learn from their experiences and this is the best way to learn. It takes away the stress from the graduates, because they learn the field they will be working at from the inside and they undertstand and know the places they can fit in.Providing the internship for the students also motivated them to be better, to stusy more. This benefits to the whole society in general. It gets the young people, who are motivated and willing to serve their country as highly prepared professionals.If the universities will provide the internship for the students it would motivate them and would benefit to the whol society in general.",4.96W17 LATs,84874,"The people that I live know it is really interesting.

The improvement that the city needs on the street is fixing the following problems that can be include in one category and have the following sub categories, first  fixing holes on the road, fixing the sidewalks, and replace the signals on the street. First, the roads in santiago de Chile, have a lot of really deep holes on the street. Some people do not even buy cars that are close to the ground, because the holes will make their cars have a lot of trouble. Also, the trouble gets bigger when it comes to the winter, because people who drive can not see the deep holes and their cars feelt on the holes, so it is worse on winter than on  other seasons. On the other hand, fixing this problem will help civilians to not have to take their cars to the repair shop so often. Also, will help people to do not have accidents while trying to evade the holes. Second, fixing the sidewalks would be a really big improvement. Santiago has a lot of old people, this means that having old people with bad sidewalks will develop eventually in a lot of accidents for these people. Also, the sidewalks in bad condition makes people be obligated to walk on the street wich can develop in people being run over by cars. Fixing the condition on the sidewalks not only will provide a safe place to walk for older people, also will provide more safety for the population. Third, the replacing of the signals on the street it is a fundamental improvement when it comes to street improvement on the street. First, replacing the signals that got run over, lost or stealed is the first thing that the city should do. Second, putting new signals where it should be signals where there are not. On the other hand, these improvements will have a really good impact on people, but not only people, also on the drivers. Fixing and putting new signals will help drivers to drive more carefully and safe, and will help people to know where they should cross the street or do certain things. To conclude, the improvements that the city of santiago de Chile should to on their streets are fixing the holes on the road, fixing the sidewalk, and fixing the signals.

Therefore, in my city, if the library are built, many students near my age would be happy. They can search the informations, study, and share their knowledges in the library.                 First of all, in the library, students can search the useful informations using books and computers. Sometimes it is hard to find informations that people want only in their homes. If there is a library, people could go there easily and find their new knowledges.

People can hold lectures or classes in the library and they can hold events like read books all the night or the book contest.

Also, if students gather in the library, they can help their studies each other or can teach studies to other people.                Therefore, building library in my city will be very helpful and be a better place to live for people in my age. When people gather in the libray to search the information, study, and share their knowledges, it helps to our city's economic growing when we think about long-term because there will be built restaurants or other stores near there.

That means to take away the tuision and qualification requirements for the people who want to get better education but no avilabe for certain reasons.  This change will benificial those students directly and benificial the city in long-term consequences.         First, many people in my age is not avilable for better education becuase of a lack of money to pay tuision. They need to work in order to support thier own living or support thier families. However, with a limited education and a limited skill, their life quality is limited as well.

I think  in my country one improvement that could be implemented is free education, because this could  reduce poverty and  violecen on the streets.         Fist, education is the strongest tool of the progress  of a society. There are too many countries where  education it is not implemented, also becouse of the poverty of some countries people dont have the money to pay a good education. In addition  there are some countries where women are forbited to achieve education. The consecuencues of this  impact in the society with a slow evolution of their economy and alows to encrease the levels of violence, I think the best solution of these problems is free education and also gave the youngest the opportunity to persue them with iqual opportunities.        Second, education  fortifie the self steam and reduce the violence in a country. I think when people is educated, have the opportunity to learn and make questions about polics, culture and morality, this questions make the human being more vulnerable tho change their actitudes about certain topic and sometimes to modefice their behavior. In addition  the cities with a higer level of education has a low percentage of violence on the streets and llow percentage of people on jail.  I think violence in my country may have and end if the goberment implement programs  related to free education, this could be beneficial for reduce the rates of violence and empower the self steam of the yungest.        In conclution, there are many neccesities that needs to be resolve in my country but one of the most important neccesities are related with education. If the goverment implement this free education the percentage of poverty and violence will reduce and more people will have the tranquility to walk on the streets and also a free education will proviede the knwoledge the the youngest people need to reduce poverty by the implemantation of social, cultural and politics proyects.",4.98F15 LATs,41946,"People that I live with now are all americans.

So, I want to talk about these problems and that need some solutions or change what I want to. There are some reasons and examples.      First of all, people want to get a job. However, it is not easy. Many companies don't want to hire many employees because now the companies' economic aren't good. Also, the companies want people who have a lot of higher skills such as English skills or computer one, and something. So people have to get a lot of skills. For example, one of my friends who prepared for getting a job don't have English skills. Also, she wanted to be hire the company. But, the company didn't want to hire her beacuse she doesn't have that. So, she had to prepare for English skills and get a interview about a job again. Therefore, I think that the companies need to decrease about their hiring standards.     Secondly, nowadays people want to take a rest or enjoy their life. But, in my country, there are just a few things or places that people can enjoy when they have an enjoyable time. For instance, my friends and I wanted to enjoy the holiday when we was able to take a rest. But, we couldn't decide to go where we took a rest because there was nothing that we could go. So, we was so sad and we had to spend time with nothing to do. So, I think that my country need to make some places that people can enjoy something.      Lastly, now students want to go to the university. But, nowadays, entering university' standards are increasing. So most of the students have to study a lot during theire high school's life. So, many students want to apply university easily. Therefore, I think that univerisities need to make diverse ways about apply to schools. Also, it can give many opportunities to students.      For these reasons, people can get some benefits from these changes. Also, they can get a job easier than before there is change. Then, they can enjoy their time or holiday with specific things. Next, students can apply the university what they want with many diverse chances.

The government should develop some factories or allows some companys stay in my city. Also, they should left their income to encourage those young people to stay in their city.        The government afraids that if they alllowed factories set in my city, that will cause some pollution problems. Because of that some family which does not have educate, they have a hard time to find a job there. Low-income family they have to apply some money from government, so most young people choose to move out to other big cities to work.  I think that if government  could set some factories and also to find out the way to solve the pollution problems that wll help a lot of families, especially for low-income family.         Also, our city the income is lower than other cities because most people only get a cleaning job or part-tome job. If government could allow some companys to develop in my city, i think that would help people to want to get a high education because they want to into a company. In additional to  help people to earn more money, helped them to be educated.        Moreover, If government could provied some special money for family who has a special needs. Most family in my city is low education and old. Their family should know the government would take the responability to take care of their family. If there were good systems, they would willing to stay or returned to their city. I think that we would have some special money that some family could apply with.        The ine improvement could help my city to be better, and help more young people to want to stay in there. Therefore, the potential immediate is to help young people to stay with their family and this city, but the  long-tern consequences of this improvement is it would cause many problems, such as pollution and some destory would happened in the future. We all waned to see the change, but we all need to know everything not be perfect.",4.99F15 LATs,12104,"Right now I am living with my two roomates, Andre and David. It is really interesting to live with them because I have learned so much with them. They have good personality and skills and they are always trying to help me with the things that I need. We have a good relationship and I am glad for that because it would be terrible to live with people that you do not like.David is a student person, he is smart and he works a lot. I am impress to see him everyday doing the best that he can on school and his job. Andre spend most of his time doing projects in the university, he is a smart guy and also it is hard to see him during the week. Andre and David are always busy and we usually hang out on weekends.One of the best parts of living with them is that they are clean! I know that it is hard to believe that 3 guys living in the same house are worried about the house. They always clean the house and organizes things that are disorganized. In my opinion, this helps our relationship as a roommates. I hope that we can keep this relationship until one of us move on.","What improvement would make Sao Paulo a better city? Sao Paulo is a huge city located in the south of Brazil. Most people know Sao Paulo as one of the biggest cities in the world. I am from Sao Paulo and I know several places there. Some people knows Sao Paulo as a 'city that never sleep' because you can find  several entertaining places to go does not matter the time. If you want to eat something fancy, tasty, or healthy, you can eat does not matter the time. Of course that all cities in the world are not perfect and they need some improvement, especially  talking about a big city. If you watch the news, the traffic and the violence are always notice. Sao Paulo needs to improve the traffic and the security.The traffic in Sao Paulo needs to improve a lot. Fifteen million of people lives in Sao Paulo right now and can you imagine how to drive is with that high number of people? Is not easy and it is totally stressful.  The worst part is that people sometimes buy more than one car, and the traffic get worse everyday. It is not easy to spend at least one hour driving to your work every day. People there are not happy with this situation and for sure, the city needs to do something to improve this issue. In my opinion, to resolve this problem, the government should set a new law that prohibit people to buy more than one car. Doing that, the number of cars would decreased and the traffic would flow more. The security in Sao Paulo is one of the negative characteristic of the city. The violence in my city has increased  every day and that affects people not just with my age, but people with all ages. The statistics show how Sao Paulo is becoming one of the most dangerous cities in the america. That is a sad statistic because Sao Paulo has a impressive history of people who used to work and people who used to live in peace. In my opinion, the government should hire more police to help the violence decrease. In conclusion, people in my age  are suffering in Sao Paulo because of the traffic and violence. Of course that exists several other issues to improve in my city. People needs to do something about it like protesting or talking to the government to make it some improvement possible. It is sad to see how big cities are destroyed by the violence and how stresfull traffic affects every one.",4.99W17 LATs,47596,"I have the wonderful opportunity to live with three awesome roommates.

For example, he always has a time for school, sports, and church.

For instance, they argue that a big arena would led young people attend to great concerts of famous international artists. Nevertheless, Bogota needs a new big library. In fact, there are two aspects that would improve in the live of young people with a new big library. Having a better place to study, and having  access to a better literature are some of these aspects.   First of all, a new big library would give young people in Bogota have a better place to study. There are small libraries in Bogota where young people could go to study. However, a big library would give young people a more comfortable place to study. To illustrate this, a new big library could have better appliances that woul help young people improve their studies. In addition to that, a new big library with better computers would improve the young people experience while learning. For instance, new computers led young people learn faster and better.   The second reason is that a new big library would give young people access to a better literature. Young people in Bogota needs a new space with an extensive literature collection. For example, having access a better literature would help young people be more prepared for university and grad school. Additionally, young people have to adquire a habit of reading, and a big new library would help doing so. For instance, if young people have a good selection of books, they would be more likely to select a book that they want to read.     In conclusion, it is imperative that Bogota would have a new big libray. Having a better place to study is very necessary for young people. Also, having access to a better literature would help young people creationg good habits. For these reasons, the government in Bogota should build a new big library as soon as possible.",5W17 LATs,63819,"People around us have a strong impact in our lives. In my personal experience, I could be able to feel a strong influence from my roommates. Living in a different country with different culture and costumes has brought many sweeping changes to my personality. I learned to be more humble and patient and all thanks to my roommates. They all are from this beautiful country and I am the nonly girl from Latin America. They are so interested about our culture and that is something that I totally appreciate. I am the person that works earlier at home. The rest start working at 8 am so usually the bathroom gets a little crowded from 6:30 to 7:30. My roommates used to saying that they admire my efforts for working that early  and going to school right after my work shift. They try to make me feel better and are always aware of me. I have been influenced for thei attitude to contribute with  everything they can to create a good environment where you can feel like home. Since they are so respectful and kind I try to do my best to follow their example. Some of them likes joking and others are more serious but when time to support each other commes they never hesitate. I totally love the people whom I live with.","Public schools have been criticised for a long time in my country. Citizens used to compalining about the way public schools provide the necessary for students to enjoy a good environment for learning. Most people agree that many improvements should be done in order to improve public schools education. This improvements would have a strong impact in the way how people of my age can use tools for making their learning meaningful. Some people has shown some solutions to this problem. The first one is about paying a certain amount of money to the school where their child goes. This payment will be used for that school to make improvements such as new equipment, building modifications and so on which would beneficiate students to have a better environment around them for learning. However, some say that they pay enough taxes to the government to agree paying even more so this solution was considered not feasible for most of the people. Second, having programms or activities sponsored for any private company to gather money to destinate to school improvements. This solution got more support than the last one. This propose was putted into practice during a short amount of time. Certainly many schools were able to gather enough money to accuire more computers and expand their computer labs. Others, destinated that money to buy some books for students whose possibilities were less than others. This possibility has increased the number of child that are not able to pay for their education but decided to go to school and take advantage of this opportunities.  Finally, asking for donations. Some schools tried to ask for international donations which for some resulted successful.  Those schools refered to their own system as 'poorly supported by the government' as a strategy for calling the attention of international institutions. This strategy tried to reach the simpathy of the people and have them donate some money for the cause. As explaned before, for some schools this has been a successful plan. However, my country's  education's reputation decreased in great  manner internationally. Schools paid the opportunity cost of using this strategy. Getting a better education could be greatly influenced by the environment where you study or the equipment you use to make it possible. Having better resources to use can change the way you learn in short and long term positive consequences as explained before. Thankfully many solutions have been already putted into practice to reach this goal.",5F15 LATs,53456,"Living with America families can be very helpful. Many internatinal students have this great opportunity to live with them. There are many positive effects in the international student's life, such as learning and improving their English skills, eating healthy food and saving money. Furthermore, the best part of everything practicing English because they are always available to speak with them, and that can help a student to learn faster English, which is one of the hardest language in the world. Thus, American families are always very helpful, and this is maybe the best way to learn English.","Having a great job can cause many good effects in Itabuna city. Any big city requires factories, industries and companies because young peole would stay and help Itabuna becomes the richest city in Brazil. To explain better why jobs would be the most important factor that would cause a great impact, it is necessary to point out three important things, such as Itabuna has a great university, it has many people living here, and it has history.                       First of all, students would think twice about leaving Itabuna if it had opportunities of work. We all know that the University of Itabuna is one of the best in Brazil, but where are these students? why they do not stay here? The lack of opportunities of job makes these smart students go out of our cities.They need a good job in which will offer a comfortable life, and Itabuna should bring more companies and factories in order to hold these students. Furthermore, the University helps a lot giving a great education and preparing them to become good leaders. If they stay here, we will have positives effects. For example, if engineers stay in Itabuna, they will build great houses and buildings. Also, they will help our city to be more clean. Thus, offering good jobs will hold our smart students in itabuna.                       Secondly, Itabuna has one of the biggest population in our state. This number of people would be very useful in our bussinesses, which relies a lot of workers. If we bring companies and factories, our economy will warm. Creating jobs is the best ways to prevent unemployments, and our people will have ways to afford their necessities without help from public programs. Itabuna does not take advantagens from having a vast population in the state. Many people from everywhere come to Itabuna to buy their necessties, and build their own bussiness in their cities. In fact, creating jobs for our population will help a lot our city to become richer.                       Tird, many people come to Itabuna to visit because of its history. As we all know, people from everywhere come here to learn about Brazil's history. Itabuna does not have some system in which we can make money from this. We should create better hotels for these people, and them they would come back. Also, we should have some kinds of activities, such as cultural parties. Hence, these people would love to come back creating good relationship with our city, and this would also create jobs for our students.                       In conclusion, we can see that creating jobs is one of the improement that our city needs to do, and this improvement would help a lot of sectors, namely Itabuna has a great university, it has many people living here, and it has history. Our city has a lot of potencial, and we need to start think about enhancing this sectors now.",5F15 LATs,25171,"In Guatemala I used to live with my family.

She do not work, she decide to take care of us the whole life and love that; maybe that is why we have a good relationship.

Something sad that is happening in Guatemala, is that many people from my age, specially with econimic problems, are quitting school and they prefer to work and help the family, that is something good, but not apropiate acording to the age. They believe that having a university degree is not as important. So, I thik if the governments improve some sources for people with economic struggles the porcentage of people with a collage dregree will increase. A good improvement would be to have better public schools with excellent teachers welling to teach and have public liberies. Those changer will make a huge difference in my country. I have heard that the main reason of why childrens quit school, is because they do not have enough money to continue paying school. It is something that has occure for many family generations and that reason is enough to let them quit school, because they did the same; they leave school and start working to help the family. The governments have the serios responsability to provide schools with an excellent educational level and they must considerate that in Guatemala we do not have an economical stability, for this reason they should have a reasonable fee to pay school. My grandfather always said that if a person is well educated there is not necessary to worry that in the future he/she will be criminal. That is why I think that good school will make a huge difference.While I was in Guatemala, I did not know that we had a public library. Even though, I had knew it, it would not make a difference, because it does not have enough books and most of the time was close. In Guatemala, we suffer several cases in which people does not know how to read or write. Governments, should encorage people to read more. How do they do this? by providing liberies with enough books and sources. 'By reading, you can discover the most greates tresures of your imagination'. Years ago I talked with a person who had a suffering life, because of her many sadly expiriences. She told me that she never had the opportunity to touch a book in her whole life and for intance, she did not know how to read. Governments should think better and how do they can help our country. There are simple things that they can do to improve the country and also people's life. I am only 19 years ols, and I do not kno much of how to improve a country, but there are some logical things that can make a difference in my country and people from my country.

One project in the city that can improve and help people with ages of twenty until twenty seven, it is to have more schorlaship in the universities for everyone. A part of population does not like to study and for that reason can be againt with this project.  However, giving more scholarship for every one, can increase the education of the city and with have less result of drugs. When the city has many smart people or have a good education, the city can improve in many aspects. Education is the base of the city, with the education is not good the city might not have many values. Education make the difference in many aspects such as natial companies can came to the city looking to hire people, the city can be regard from the governament of the country, and the quality of life can be better for the families that lives there. For example, James came from a poor family, he does not have money to pay to study at university, he works full time,but he does not has many knowledge. Because  James recived a scholarship from the governament of the city, James had the opportunity to complete his univerty and was hired by a national company. Education can be a door of improvement of the city because education make smart people.When people have many things to do they don't have time to thing in bad things. The act of violation and a higher consume of drugs came because people do not know what they do with the time and this result to try new easy and different things such as drugs.  Drugs can damage many people because make to be independent from that. Many families lost they houses,friends, possetion because of drugs. Usually people start to use drugs because they don't know how they can use the time, they can not work or study, they are free all day, and this influece they to experiment a new thing that will make they day different, but if they are busy all day they dont have time to think about that.  For example,  Gabriel does not like to work and study , he does not do anything during all day, but one day, he went to with his friends and one of them influenced Gabriel to experiment drugs. After a couple of days Grabiriel was influenced by drugs and every day he needed to consume. If the governament give more schorlarship, poeple can use the time useful and they dont have time to do different things that is inapropriate to others.In conclusion, giving schoarship for everyone the city will have more smart people and less drugs users. With this project the city can be a better place showing improvement and better quality of life. Many people and family can be benefit from this spcecially people from the age twenty until twenty-seven because they are looking for oportunities to chage, to be a better person etc.  This can result a long-term because take a while for everyone to accept and understand this project , it all depends of governament of the city and how the population will reacti with this iniciative.

However, the city development has been very slow the couple last years. I think one improvement that would make my city a better place to live would be new technology. Technology would help people to have a better education and to increase jobs opportunities.First, technology would help to have a better eduaction because it would help to the students to learn faster all the subjects. Using videos, movies, computers, etc the class environment could be more dynamic and fun. This method would permit the students to comprehend  the class and retain more information in their brains. For example, my friend's math class was really hard to understand for her, until her teacher start to use a computer program during the class. Techonology in my city would help in academical success.  Second, techonology would increase jobs opportunuties. Every company needs to acelerate the production  in order to get more incomes. Technology allows to the companies to produce more in less time. With this implement, companies would need more employees to manipulate the machines. For instance, when one company introduced new equipments, they  would hire more people to train and to  work with them. The benefit of technology in my city would have a significant impact because it will help people to get a good job. In conclusion, technology would make my city a better place to live for people of my age because it would help people to have a better education and it would increase job opportunities.

Guadalajara has the largest university in Jalisco and sometimes is very hard to arrive early to school because morning trafic is to heavy. Actually there are 3 routes that belong to university and help students to stay early in school but this doesn't work in a good way because there are almost 2 million of university students in Guadalajara. Thats why more routes can will be good for students and people in 3 principal ways, fisrt students can will be early in school and second it is will be possible to avoid accidents, and more routes can provide work for people that is looking for.Students can will be early in classes. This is the principal problem in Guadalajara with university students because a lot of students live away from school and they sometimes they need take 3 or 4 busses for arrive to school. If government put more routes for university students that can cover more places in the city this will be different not just because students will be early in their classes, most important of that is that they will have better grades and that can be useful for have a better live. Is incredible but is true see how a little change can affect other aspects in students live.At the same time that we can be early in clases we can avoid accidents by the cause of we wont need drive. Is true that young people sometimes don't have limist and that includes speed limits specially when we are late. With more routes of public transportation students can take the bus and they can be relax knowing that the bus is goig to take them save and secure to school. At the same time is possible to reduce the trafic mornings because a lot of studesnt will be use the routes from University allowin to other drivers be safe and secure too. We can thing that public trasportation is just an option if you don't want drive but is important for some people because is a good way for have a job too and this last can be an adventage for people that actually is looking for a job because these routes can provide it. So, if one thing can be better in my city is public transportation because is good for students that can be early in classes and this at the same time is going to contribute for have a shining future for them and is a good way for have a job for people that is actually  need it.",5.02W17 LATs,74729,"Nowadays, I am living with roommates in Riviera.

Everyday and everynight the traffic is huge, increasing the stress and violence inside the society. They face a lack of organization, causing too much problems and barely no solutions. For that reason, if they start to think how they can solve these challenges, they will find more peace and a great development in the society. Besides many reasons, if they organize a cheaper way to rent a car, and having specific days to allow cars to drive, it can be a good beginning for solving all problems.         First, The process to rent a car is universal, however, some places are more expensive than others. The economy in Sao Paulo is pretty high; it means that renting a car can be more expensive than getting a public  bus. Therefore, if the government starts reducing the price of rental cars,  it will be acessable for everyone to get a car, being less stressed about the violence. In opposition, there will be more traffic in avenues, causing more pollution and other problems. In summary, it is very important for the society, changing public busses for rental cars. The organization starts being easier to have.          Next step is about specific days that cars can be driven on the city roads. Sao Paulo is the biggest city in Brazil; in other words, there are many people that depend of car or public bus to work or study. Then, traffic occurs because many people need to leave at the same time. For that reason, if the government creates a control method of cars driven around the city, there will be a great progress for everyone. Such as specific number car tags cannot drive on Mondays, or all cars that have the number six as the last number, these cars cannot drive. In opposition, even though there will be this law, many people will break or even ignore it. Nevertheless, there will be more organization and less traffic on the roads and avenues.          In Conclusion, Sao Paulo need to be fixed for many reasons; but if the government starts the process to have cheaper cars to rent, and the control methods of cars, it will be possible to see a evolution of this society. There will be a significant decrease of violence and stress. With these methods in action, everyone can be happier to do their things and the government can worry with important things and better resources to help the society for being safer and more comfortable.",5.02W17 LATs,75784,"In the past, I use to live with just one guy.

In my city, we do not have a gym, and almost half of the population has to go to another city in order to go to the gym. In my city, a gym would be an significant improvment, especially for people of my age so that they can stay healty, and they can become better at sports. The first reason in wish a gym would be an improvement in my city is that people need to go somewhere to stay healthy. In fact, exercising help considerably the body to eliminate bad substances in the body. It also, by wheight lifting,  help muscles become stronger. Moreover, People become more attractive when they practice sport in a gym. All these reason help people become healthier and not fatter. For example, If people just stay at their home they will become fat and they will not be attractive as they could, and they also may have some health problems. Another reason is that if my city open a gym,  people and specially young people of my age will be able to improve their skills in different kind of sports. Furthermore, they will be able to specialised in the sports they wants because they will be able to go more often in the gym as the gym will be in the city and so closer. They will not have to go far away in another city to find a gym. For instance, if the gym is in another city, young people will struggle to go there often because of transportation problems, or waste of time during the trip. Moreover, they will become better at sport because many young people of my age in my city do not practice sports, and if a gym open, they will be able to practice sport and find some hidden talents that they possess. Some of them may pactice gym until they become olympic champions.In conclusion, the potential immediate that a gym will generate in my city, is that people will all start to speak about it and they will all stop to go in other city to go to the gym, it will withdraw some traffic in the streets and they will also be more people wlaking in the city to go to the new gym.

The city has almost 25 million people whit millions of cars, factories, and industries producing air pollution. The city needs urgent chances in its policies in order to improve the environment. The two main changes that can be done are regulate the trafic, and improve the public transporttion.    The government should make some chances to improve the movement of the cars in the city. A single person can spend more than 1 hour in trafic every day wasting gasoline and time. The goverment should try fix and improve the time and the link among the stop lights. This could save time and energy needed for cars. In addition, the goverment should ask to police officers to accelerate and improve the transit of cars in the most transitated avenues. This two simple but effective actions could improve the movemet of cars in the cities making the air cleaner for population.    Also, the public transportation mus be improved and increased to serve to the population and save energy. Public transportation is something that can save time, space, and energy through takeing many people in it with the same direction. It is well known that no all the people share their car but public transportation can be shared betwen many people. Governmens should facilitate  enough public transportation to save energy and keep clean and avoid the air pollution.    Regulate the trafic, and improve the public transporttion are the two main changes that the government could to improve the air quality. The government should fix the stop lights, and increase the ammount of police officers in order to keep the movement of the cars. Second, public transportation should be improved to save energy.

Human beings are willing to pay for doing exercise. However, people in my ages do not have enough money to go to gym. Thus, the improvement of public sports area would make my city a better place to live for people my age. Here are my reasons.Taipei, my hometown, has plenty of facilities that we can do sports. Nonetheless, because of high density of population, it is always hard to find a place that every individual can do excercise with enough space.  In this consequence, people become too lazy to go out and play sports. Instead, people in my age would like to play video games. The govenment noticed this problem. Therefore, the government built two hundred public sport areas near the  in riverside in Taipei. And a survey shown in 2010 that people in 20s' were more willing to go outside and play sports.Addtionally, excercise could make people in my age healthier. Another survey in 2008, people were fatter than before in the same age. Expecially the people in my age. After the government built the facilities that was mentinoned in previous paragraph, another survey caom out. In 2012, people became healthier in Taipei, and human beings in my age had the most effective change.

I have analized this situation and I found that we have a problem with the time and with our education. I know if we choose the right, we will have more success in our lives.When I was in High School, frequently I saw young people doing bad choices. For example, once I saw a guy stealing the food of other boy and then he sold the food to other people, but this was not the only thing that I saw, I feel that I was wasting my time doing 'nothing'. We had a lot of free time and we was spending time in things that will not bring us the success that everybody wants. This is a big problem when you do not use your time with wisdom.Many studies have been listed with a lot of differents topics about the problems of the young people. The Usco University recognized that their were teaching the teory of each carrer but they needed to add another topic and subject to teach, 'Use Your Time With Wisdom'. I was studing there when it was created and I helped the university to do activities and projects for them. I proposed that the university could have a laboratory open all the day and avery day of the week. Then, we had more young people participating of the laboratory and they were not smoking, taking drugs at the park or in partys having sex, they were studying and practice at nights what they learned in the morning.Other thing that was so important in this process was the kind of education that the High Schools gave to the young people and how the High Schools prepared the students for the University. With the activities that we did, I decided to meet the teachers of each School of the city with the students and let the students tell them what they need to be prepared for the University.The University got to rescue a lot of young people who were losting theirs degree with the activities and projects that we did. We saw an increase of 46% more young people in class room and getting the certificates and the bachelor degree.I know that these projects could help other cities to have more people prepared to do the jobs that cityneeds and then we will have a lot of young people choosing the right.",5.04S17 Placement,03599,"I live with my family, I'm a married man, so I live with my wife, two doughters and my brother in law.My wife it's a marvellous woman, her name is Leonor and she's 35 years old, she use a short hair style, and usually tint it bond just because I ove how she looks with blond hair, she also make cakes and she is very good at it, she loves our doughters, she's not tall, and love cooking for us.My older dougher name is Alana, she's 9 years old and love ciences, she also love her little sister and usually get involved in problems for her sister, she's a skinny girl, with blond hair, withe skin, and beautifull kind of green eyes.Maira it's our baby, she's 4 years old, and has so many enegy, she gives love to everyone, and learn really quick english, she aslo has multiple food allergies, so it's been a great bless came here to U.S. because we find so many food that she can eat without problems, she's a short girl who's alwais moving and running, and love to live in the U.S.My brother in law it's gabriel, he's a great guy, he also studies at ELC, now he's in his brake and has become a great support for us, he helps us a lot in what we have to do ans how do it easier.","Santiago it's a small city, but have millions of persons living in there, actually almost the half of all the population of Chile lives in Santiago, also almost every family has at least one car, so the mornings and evenings all suffer of a lot of traffic, because there are many people who's not using the public transport.One of the improvements that could be done it ecourage the use of bycicles, will helps a lot to release the streets of the cars in the top times (mornings and evenings), for that more ways just for bycicles need to be done, but helps to disencrease the concentration of smog in the air, also helps to the people to have more physical activity, as the WHO has said, this will also helps to slow down the obbesity in the people, especially young adults, young men and women and kids, giving them in the long therm a better health to all that practice it.There're some countries as France, who has developed laws to help the companies to encourage to there crow to use the bycicles, giving them discount in the payment of taxes, and also the companies has given to the workers  bonus in money for use bycicles, that was receave very good for the work force in the companies who strats with this politics.Another think that also it's important it's that you can buy a very good, modern and new bycicle with the same payment that you do in  a month for a part of a car, you don't need a big space to have the bycicle but many times people pay a lot for a parking space for a car, so if we go to economics, its also better to have a bycicle because helps you to save money, wich is very important, Santiago it's been bulding to the hight, many apartments, buildings of 20 or more floors, and  without many parking spaces.So encorege the use of the bycicle will be a great improvement for Santiago, will help to the people to have more physical activity, reduce the hard traffic at the rush times (mornings and evenings), will helps to companies with taxes if the right publics politics are develop, and helps to the people to save space and money in a city wich is over poblated.",5.04F15 LATs,62691,"Nowadyas, I'm living with my family,that is my parents, my little brother and my young sister.

Also, you have many outdoor activities that you can do with your family or alone. In Recife, people have a lot of facilities to use, such as public service. For example, you can take a bus for wherever you want and you only need to pay 1 dollar for this service. However these things, we have a huge problem in my city. One of this problem that need to fix is with the security. Recife is very dangerous place, specially if you are  a tourist.     In Recife the case of violence are rate a lot, specially during the important holidays, such as Christmas or New eyear. The people are scarry to stay out of their homes after 10 p.m.There are some things that the gorvenment could do to improve this situation. First of all, focus on educational system, specially with the young people, In Brazil, many young people do not want to go to school, and they do not have a good education, so in a couple years this people probably will not find a job and then they going to start to do bad things to obtain money. So, if the government focus on this, probably the number of violence will be low in a couple years.     Second, The government needs to invest more in the police, hiring more policemen and provide to them an effective trainment, so they will be able to work correctly with the thieves. Also, it is very important have a good tools to work againts the crime. Nowadays, in Recife the police do not have good tools to fight against the crime. So, it is necessary that government provides good tools for the police or the cops will never be efective against the thieves.For example, if the cops have a good technology to work they will be able to recogonize and find faster the crimers and put them in the jail. This improvement will have an immediate result against the violence in this beautiful city.      As we see , In Recife we have a big problem with the crime, and we have two things that we need to work to solve this problem.First of all, work with educational system, specially with the young people, in this case we will prevent for the future because this young people could be the future thieves of our society, if we o not take care about them. Second , and the immendiate consequences. The government needs to provide more cops to the police and better tools to cops, so they will be able to work better and effectivily than now.",5.05F15 LATs,61936,"I'm currently living  with my brother and his wife .

Teenagers and Adults from 18-30 years are getting involved on this situations. Some people said that placing the criminal on jail would make better the society,but the real improvement would be if the goverment could set some educational rules for  people on this ages and also their parents. Education will always be the solution for all the problems of society, and an honest team that could verify the rules that could be setted will provide a hug impact in Mexico. Education will always be the solution for all the problems of the society. Where we grow up, were we live, who we are related to, and the type of ambiance were we live makes a huge impact in our lives. If you live in an area were they have the culture to study and become someone that could help the society, you probably wont notice the other part. Teenagers that live in an area that the best way to gain money is stealing or hurting others, would have a different mind, and would probably dont't care about studying and improving  their way to live. For example, a margin area in Mexico is Tepito, an area were they steal, consume illegal substances, etc. doesn't have the same level of education as  Santa fe, an other rich area from the same city. If tepitos people don't have the same oportunities they would probably become bad people. Education can change the world once we take the chance to experiment its benefits.Rules or laws are needed to control the people in all the countris , but it is more important to have a good team that could verify the laws apliance. A law that allows teenagers to study instead of being 'free' and work in something that they don't deserve is needed. For example, In The United States, it is required for all teenagers to study. It is not optional. If a teenager is not studing or is having problems with attendance, the school and event the state could punish the stundents' parents. The develompent starts on or early years of life. Those laws and a good team that control them would help the society to have a sane generation of teenagers and adults that would take care of themselves and their families in the future. The law along with the education are the perfect combination to at least have a major pecentage of develompent in a country.  It is neccessary that Mexico could set this kind of laws, but also provides the level of educatin that all the Mexicans deserve. Corruption is a bad phenomenon in Mexico. Thats why the society, specially teenagers and young adults,  can't grow as they suppouse to. If we never have laws that support the education, we would never have the solution for almost all of the problems that society face now a days. We need to encourage this generation to make a possitive impact on Mexico. Mexico needs education. Mexico needs more people to help to develop the country, and that people are the one that are growing right now, the teenagers and the young adults.",5.05F15 LATs,28977,"I live with my wife for more than two years, not only in Taiwan but also in the US.

That is not only because the bad situation of labor right but also the extreme high price of the houses in Taiwan. The way to solve this problem is to increase the wage of the labors as high as the other countries where the labors can produce the same quality products as Taiwaneses labors.In the field of manufactur, Taiwan is a great brand for the products. The output with MIT, which means 'made in Taiwan', always is high quality and in affordable price. That is because the labors in Taiwan usually have good education and are honest to their companies. However, even though they create the world-class performance, labors in Taiwan can not receieve a fair wage. The GDP of Taiwan is keeping increasing for more than thirty years. However, the average income of the employers is consistent for sixteen years. The contribute of the labors does not reflect on their salary. In order to support their family spend, young employers have to work for a long time. Although they work more than sixty hours per week, that is twelve hours per day, five days a week, the salary still can not afford to buy an apartment in urban area such as Taipei and Shinchu.If the wage of the labors is increased, young parants won't have to work as long as now. They will have enough money to support they life and have time to compatant with their children, so that they can save some money from babysitter or privant schools, which offer more care to the kids than public school. And if people who do not need to work for very long, they can spend more time on the traffic. Therefore, young people want to live far away the center of the city. And it will cause the price of the apartments in the city decrease. Without the press of the loan of the house, people will have more freedom to spend money. It is not a benefit for the people whose salary is increased but also for the economy of the whole society. In sum, to increase the salary for the labors in Taiwan has a lot of benefits. It can resolve the problem that the lowest brith rate. It also can stop increasing the price of the apartments in the city. The people in my age will be happier than now.",5.05W17 LATs,44528,"I lived most part of my life with my mother and sisters. My mother is the best person in the world.

It is very famous for the funny artists and beautiful beaches. However, as a big city, it has some major problems that it has some improvements could make it almost perfect. Increasing the security and minimizing the traffic are some ares that require a fast improvementThe first improvement should be in the security area. Fortaleza has a high rate of crimes and thiefs. Also, people between 20 and 30 used to hangout a lot with friend and used to return very late to home what make very dangerous. If the government invest more on security people would go enjoy friend more relaxed than actualy. Additionally, this actions should atract more people to the city, increasind the turism rates. Fortaleza has one of the most beatiful beaches in the world, the weather is wonderful, and it is not a expensive city. These are factors very important for turism, but the high criminal rates make people unsafe. It is commom see some people being stolen on the street. In fact, I passed for this experience one time before. I went to a club with friend and when we are going to home two people took all of our cellphones. It was very bad, but we still alive.Another point is to improve the roads and traffic. Most part of Fortaleza still the same than 15 years ago, what is not a bad thing if people consider the preservation of the city. However, every year the number of people and cars grow and roads do not have space for all cars. Many people spend more than 4 hours per day driving to work and home. This is so much time to spend inside the car. If the government do not change or make a improviment people will lose a important time of their lives. They will be more stressed, and as consequecy, they will have more deseases and other problems. Furthermore, this time should be used with family or actitivities that brings a better life quality. They will feel more relaxed and will work better, what can result in a better economy to the city. Also, parents will have more time to spend with their children, and they will have a better education with the presence of their parents.An improvement on the traffic and security will make Fortaleza a better city to people who lives there and people who want know to know one of the most beautiful city in the world.",5.06W17 LATs,54867,"I am getting married in 8 days.

If I list only one improvement that would make my city a better place to live for people who are my age is job positions. It has been really hard to find job in Mongolia. Even though people who have good grades or graduated from best universities in Mongolia. It is because most companies or governments require experiences more than good grades.  They require at least 3 years of experiences or more. But it is impossible. How come they will have experiences like years and years. I strongly disagree with their requirements. Although, those people who have studied for 4 years for bachelor degree and 2 years for the master degree; they cannot find any place to work and they are discouraged to accomplish their goal. If government wants to make a better place to live for their people, they need to allow young people to work and get experienced there. But it is still not working in Mongolia, they still don't hire people who don't have experience. If there is anytime, companies and other businesses support young people to do their internships in their companies, young people can get experiences there. They will work hard and will enjoy what they do. I want to mention few things: First, If it happens someday, the city they live will be much better place to live. Most young people who have such desire to work hard and they have such a good ideas to develop their city, state and country. Those people bring such bright future to the city where they live.Second, there will be many educated people who will work for their companies, businesses and even for the government. There is a quote which says ' Practice makes Perfect' that means, they may not have any work experiences but they can do it and they will have that experience in the future. Third, young people have great responsibilities. For example, they are always on time, they listen to their leaders, boss and supervisors. They are fast learners and motivated souls. Lastly, they work so hard.In conclusion, when country have such talented and educated young generations, they should not worry for the future of country. They can rely on their generations. Immediate consequences that can be shown in their cities and long-term consequences will shown in the country. They will develop their city and then they will develop their county. Young people are the future of country.",5.06W17 LATs,51732,"During these days I have been living with roommates. They are from diiferent cities and countries, let 's start with Daivid.

This beautiful city is in the south of Peru, and it have been considered one of the most wonderfull places in Peru. In my personal opinio, I believe it is the most beautiful city in Peru. In addition, it has a lot of variety, food, touristic places, extraordinary views and beautiful buildings. However, it does not mean that this city doesnt need some improvments. Especially for youger people who need this improvments, they will recieve more benefits. Thus, these improvments are infraestructures and education.Infraestructure is one of the most important features to develop in one city. Arequipa has a beatuful buildings on his downtown and around it. These come from the colony age. However. outside of the downtown new buildings need to be more modern. These new buildings can offer to the youth new opprtunities. Encouraging invest to build these new and modern buildings. Thus, the economy will see a good effect, which at the same time will bring jobs. People will see the benefits to brings moder buildings to the city , economicaly, and with more beautiful and secure building, where people can live or work. With this improvment the city will see a beatifull buildings and bring more oppotinities to the youth.University eduaction is one of the most important thing to improve to benefit the youth. Arequipa has many colleges, the most important are , UNSA,UNSM and UCSP., these are very good, but need to make improvments in the quality. Perhaps are good in among the colleges in Peru, but we are looking for them can be the best eduaction can offer. Thus, the youth in Arequipa can have the ooprtinity to access to high eduaction able to rivalize with international colleges, and who know maybe with USA colleges. This is a very important thing to improve in Arequipa. Eduaction improvment will bring high education to the youth.These improvments can really make a difference to people of my age. Even when this city has many good features and their citiziens are very proud of it. It need some improvements to make. These improvments will birng a lot of possitive effects in the people, but especially for the youth in Arequipa. I love my city , this is the most beautiful city in Peru. However, I am pretty sure that these improvments in education and infraestructure will change the city to great position in the world.

We know that we are not perfect, and we are still making mistakes, but improvement is the way that we can be better; improvement is the way that we change our mistakes to our strengths and make them better. People try to improve all the time as well as country and city. I live in Udonthani, Thailand, and there are many things that we can improve to make this city better, especially for students my age in schools. Some people think that giving more money to students in school can make schools and students better. However, I think that changing one little rule of schools can make a lot of differences, which is school should let their students to wear their outfit freely and do not use school uniform anymore. Students that can wear whatever they want, will perform better and will be happier.           Making schools to be without their uniforms can help with the performance of their students. Students that can wear whatever they like to school tend to perform better in their learning and their knowledge. A lot of research confirm that people that can wear anything they like to their test will perform their tests so much better than people that need to wear what people needed them to wear. I agree with this. The example that I saw obviously is the international school in Thailand. There, people can wear anything to their schools, and they are more confident. They learn faster than my school, and they are a top five school in Thailand. According to this exasmple, I believe that students that do not wear school uniform perform better.        Making schools to be without their uniforms can help their students to be happier. This can be proved with many research as well. I believe that one of the goals of many schools is seeing their students being better and happier in their lives. So, I know that if we can wear anything to school can make us be happier. For example, when I was in Thailand, I tried to like my school uniform and thought that it was there for some good reasons. However, in one summer, I went to Bangkok and attended at International school there. I loved their so much and I felt a lot happier because I could wear anything there, and my grades were better as well.          In summary, making school not to have uniforms can help their students to be happier and can help with the performance of their students. Changing this little rule can make a lot of better differences for my city. I believe that changing this can help students in their individual performance and their individual happiness. Making school to not require their students outfit can also help their society to be happier and more successful. Moreover, this little change can develop to the success for the nation. I have a strong believe that everything would be so much better without school uniforms.",5.06F15 LATs,44788,"This semester was the best with my roommates. Everyone says, and I also think that my apartment is the mos diverse in the whole Riviera. We are 6 people living there, and all from different countries. There is a girl from Africa. Her name is Tata. She is pretty tall and thin. The other roommate is from Japan, she is a very cute girl. Also, there is a girl from Brazil. Her name is Thiffany and she is one of my favorites roomates. she speaks Spanish, maybe that's why we get along better. The other two girls are Americans. I really love them. They are always helping me improving my English. We are all different, and because of that we are very close friends. We are alwasy busy, so we mostly see each other at nights. Everyone works and study at the same time. However, we always find a time to spend together as a little family.","Thinking about one improvement that will help my city being a better place to live is having more security. We all know that crime is everywhere, but to reduce crime and people being hurt it will be good to have police officers on streets. Some people may think it's not necessary, but it is. Two main reasons are the following: people will be protected and this will build trust in everyone.To begin, an innmediate consequence of having police officers on the streets will help people feel secure and protected. We all know that crime is a fact that can affect anyone. For example, today a robber decides entering in your house instead of your neighbor's house. Having police officers surrounding streets can help avoiding crime and bandalism. Everyone would feel secure and can enjoy spending time inside and outside their houses.Moreover, having police officers in every part of the town can help people build trust in others. They can give permission to their children to play outside their houses and meet new people. For example, parents would feel relaxed if their children are playing in the park that is a block away their houses. They would be friendly with other people they meet on the streets and also make good relationships. Last but not least, the entire community would feel safe. If they see police officers, they wouldn't be afraid. Altough there still being bad people with bad intentions, people will feel safe if they see a police officer close to them. All people need heroes, and that is why police officers exists. To take care of them and to stablish peace around the community they live.In summary, this will be the inmediate and long-term consequences of having more police officers in my town. This will not only help people of my age, but everyone. Having a strong security system in the streets will help improving good relationships with everyone. Small things in life would be enjoyed and everyone would live happier and safe having police officers close to them.",5.06F15 LATs,18738,"people who live with me are very crucial parts of my lfe. All of them, my sister is the best friend in my family. For her apperances, my and her apperance are almost same, so many people said that we looks like twin. We have same hair style, eye shape, face shape, lip shape. However, we have different personalities. She is very sensitive, so she plans everything that she has to do. It is good characteristic for her because it makes her work hard. My sister is junior in unversity, and her major is business administration.  Due to her major, her interests is a financial part of business, and she want to get a job of this part. I really like to live with her. Even though we fight sometimes, we spend a lot of happy times","Sometimes, small change makes the city much better, so it's better to think about the aspect that the city need to improve for us. It will be easy to think just one thing which can only help for your age. For universities' students, changing something for universities will make improvement for our city a better place to live. Therefore, the city need to try to cut universities' tuition because it will give students more chance to enjoy their lives, and makes them study more. As a result, it makes city much better place to live.Less tuition can give more chance to students for enjoying thier lives. It means that they don't need to work for their rest time, and they will have time to find their interests or hobbies. Students who attend national universities in their countries have more free time than others. For example, they make several activities by using money that they don't need to use their tuition. They make groups, enjoy their interests, and share thier hobbies. If they have to work after school, they won't be have time to these activities. It will helpful for city to get improvement because students are important sources of every country. They have a lot of potentiality to make city better in the long-term. It has positvie effects for individuals and societies.The improvement which cut the universities' tuition also makes students study more than before. Because they can save their money from their tuition, they can use that money for studying at other countries and going to academy. These can be the great benefits for students because there are so many students who can't go abroad due to money. For instance, if a student go to abroad, he or she will study English or other languages and get a lot of experiences of other countries. This student would have positive though about the city because it gave she or he special memories. Finally, if she or he gives her or his knowledge to the city, the city and the student can help each other.Because less tuition helps students our age to study and enjoy in better conditions, it's the best imovement for us. If the city have this change, many students want to go to the university in that city. This means that the city will have a lot of intelligent students, and it will be connected with city's improvement. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that cutting tuitions can be the best way in long-term to make the city a better place by having a lot of potential students who have many chances than other countries' sutdents.",5.08F15 LATs,69234,"Since I moved to Utah I have been living with three roomates. They are awesome; in addition, one of them served his mission in my country and we are closed friends. I have really close relationships with my roomates; ergo, we spend time playing games, going to the gym, and watching movies. Erick who is from Arizona is studying his master in public health at  BYU; therefore, he spent a lot of time in the university and he is not able to work. On the other hand,  my other roomate is Brian from china; currently, he is not studying. Brian told me that he is not studying because he needs to save money in order to pay for his major; in addition,  he strove to get into UVU. However, UVU is expensive and now he wants to apply to BYU. In conclusion, I think that my roomates are great they have great personalities as well as a good quality of life. Moreover, they are members of the church; therefore, they live a life wit principles and values","What make a city a great place to live? Throughout history people have been striving to have a good quality of life. Improvements in the 21st century had been made in many aspects such as health, technology, and science. Nevertheless, recently data had showed that citizens needed to have a good transportations system in order to obtain a healthy existence. Having an effective transportations system will give my generation a better quality of life and maximize our development.Avoiding traffic in our highway system will give us the chance to save time and become more organize while dealing with our daily problems. In addition, people are going to be able to spend more time with their families and friends as well as doing extra curricular activities; for example, they are going to have more chance to eat breakfast with their family; instead of, running to get the bus or driving fast. Recently data has showed that having less problems in transportation help people to avoid anxiety and stress. Therefore, It will be great to have a great transportation system in my city in order to be mentally healthy. On the other hand, people might have other problem such as pollution made by transportations such as cars, trains, motocicles, etc. Moreoever, it is important to control gas emissions from the transportation vehicles. While technology advances improve, people will strive to have the best quality vehicles. Ergo, governments had made some policies for transportations business; in addition,  recenlty advances in technology had developed better engine systems in cars and trains; those advances are supported by many governments all around the globe. Therefore, researchers are working in order to formulate better transportations tools for our cities.In conclusion, having  a better quality of life wraps up many subjects such as health, spend time with your love ones, and be able to manage high technology systems. For all these reason, transportation is the most important point to focus on; changing the transportation system will allow us to become a high developing city as well as organize.",5.11F15 LATs,07185,"When I was in the Dominican Republic I oviously used to live with my family. My family concists of six members. My mom and dad and my three siblings. I am the youngest in my family, so they all really loved me. I am the favorite son and brother. My dad is 53 years old he looks a lot like me, he is a business administrator, so he is the owner of colgate in DR.  but he has problems in his left knee so he can not do too much physical activity so he is a little overweight right now. My mother is the most beautifull woman on earth. She is also 53 but she seams younger than my dad, she is really short, has long black hear and big eyes. My first sister is the older, she is married and has five children. My next sister is 27 years old she has one baby boy and now is pregnant with tweens. Then my brother, who  is 26 years old and got married two years ago he still studying, so he not planning to have offspring right now.","In the last years Puero Plata has been one of the places with more car accidents in the Dominican Republic. When children start to grow up they turn more adventurous. You must be sixteen yers old to be able to start driving. As soon as my friend and I turned Sixteen we took the test to be able to start driving. They usually give you the permission really easily, but in my oopinion this is not the prblem. They are the massively dangerous aspects of the roads in Puerto Plata that makes them so danegrous: the wether, lack of lights in the roads, and not enough Police officers.      First,  as you should probably know, the Dominican Republic is a tropical rain forrest so we have a lot of rain. When it is reaining the vission for drivers is really not the greatest. It is really difficult to drive with this circumstances because the roads are really thin, so you cannot see the cars that are coming twords you. This is very dangerous my parents would not let me drive when it was raining too much. Also our streets are not the best one because the rain causes many holes in it. When this holes are filled with water and you drive over them it is very easy to lose control and this ncreases the posibily of car accidents. The government should be really worried about this because each year many young people die because the roads are really irregular. With the implementation of better and modern materials in roads this will be realy well prevented.      Second, Puerto Plata is a really small city, most of our parents have their houses in the outside of the cities. when we started going to highschool we started to like to have fun going to the movies or just having dinner in the nights, after school. The outsides of the city are really dark and there is no loght in the streets. It is not hard to se other cars because the have light. The problem is with animals. There are usually many Cows, Horses and Dogs  that cause many accidents. I have lost many good friends because of car accidents in the dark nights of  Puerto Plata. Much more lights should be added not only arround the roads, but also light in the center to that they can see the divissions of each road.       Finally, one of the greatest problems with traffic in Puerto Plata is that we barely have Police Officers in charge of the traffic. They usually do not do their job. They usually go search for woman or spend the whole day drinking in a local bar and this is really sad and dessapointing. Many young people think that they can do whatever they want when they are driving, so they cause many accidents, not only to other young people, but also to adults and to entire families. This is really sad, but it is the relity. This is a problem of education. Anyone could be a oliceman where I live. Maybe if they were better trained and had a better salary they would be much more better in their job        Car accidents can be really tragic, dangerous and fatal. This is a sad reality of the place I live. Some times it just happens and you cannot blame anyone because the local wether is not the best wether for drivers. On the other hand it is really sad when a life is lost because some one was not being responsible , but muh more sad when they could have been saved, but no one was able to help them on time because the person in charged of that area was not doing his job. I know that if we had better officers and better roads many livescould be safe in Puerto Plata and in the Dominican Republic.",5.12W17 LATs,57868,"Many people when got in the United State have roommates, but they always said: My roommates are so mean, but in my case I love my roommates.

One of the thing that a lot of people used every day when they need to go to work is the transportation, but there are many problem with the bus, for instance, the goverment need to spend more money to fix it because the buses are not comfortable, they are so expensive, and they always are broken.Many people used transportation when they need to go for some places as work, shopping, museum, park, etc; but there are a big problem with the buses because they are not comfortable, for instance, sometimes the chair when you sit are broken, or early in the morning there are a lot of people that used the transportation and you can moved in there, the buses are so crowded. Sometime you need to wait a long time to take a bus because the bus is full and you can't used it, and you lost many time. Also, the most common problem is when you want to leave of the bus, but there are many people so you can't do it. In fact, buses are so incomfortable in all moment and the goverment need to improve or spend more money to fix it.Buses are so expensive for normal workers. Some rich people said that buses need to be expensive because if you don't have car you need to spend more money in transportation. That is a bad idea because if the people don't have car is becase don't have money too, and can't pay it. Every year there are protest about the transportation because every year the buses are more and more expensive. The people protest because the buses are expensive but they are not comfortable or are broken. In sum, the goverment need to fix and reduce the price of the buses because each time the buses are more expensive and broken.The most commom problem with the buses is when they broke in the middle of the trip. It is a big problem because all people need to work and have a time to arrive at work, but sometimes they lost their work because arrive late, and that is because the buses are so old and broken. The buses are like 20 years old and they have a lot of problems. The most commom problems are flat tire, engine. In the same years could be happen a lot of time, that the bus has a problem and the workers need to wait for the next bus that take like 1 hour to arrive there. In conclusion, the goverment need to understand that they need to do change in the transportation because it is too old.In conclusion, goverment need to fix the old buses because if they fix the buses that are really broken the buses will be more comfortable. And if the bus is comfortable the people stay happy and they will not have problem to pay the price of the bus because it is the best alternative and give us a good service. If they do it the people will not protest again and the goverment will not have problem. They need to fix it and spend money.",5.15F15 LATs,08391,"I usually lived with my shole family in Argentina.

If people talk about  improvements, they will focus in different areas, such as, jobs and education.  For people in their twenties work and education are their main focus in life because they want to be prepared and be better to establish a family in the future. Linking this conceived idea with my own city, education is one of the greatest improvements that my city could make to be a better place to live for people my age. Definitely, this change will bring profund impact in our peruvian young society.               First, the city will decrease the number of illetrated people. In many different parts of my city people don't have the opportunity to go to school. At a young age, they need to start to work in farms or in agriculture. They don't learn how to write or how to read.  An example is a city named Pomacocha, in the mountanious part in my country . Children don't attend to shool because they don't have schools in their cities. Of course, if they continue doing the same work everyday, they won't have the opportunity to improve and change their lives. They receive a low payment for their hard work and they loose this time of their lives just working. Some years ago, the statistics in Peru showed that even though the technology has benefited many countries around the world, Peru still have many iletrated people because the government doesn't invest the money for a better education for these rural areas in my country. A visible investment in the education of this people could decrease the number of illetrated people in Peru.             Second,  young people will be able to go to the university and receive the education they deserve. Because the government doesn't invest the money for education, many smart and talented people can't attend to University. It have have been proven that only people who are wealthy are the only ones who can attend University in Peru. Private Univerities are really expensive and other universities have only some places for thousands of young people who need to study there. For example, the universitie of San Marcos is a university which is not private. This is a very good university , but they only accept a limited number of students and there are more than five thousands young people who want to be accepted. In the other hand, universities, such as, San Ignacio de Loyola or  San Martin de Porres are private. In this case, it is not difficult to be accepted by these universities, but they are highly expensive. In fact, people who are not wealthy doesn't have the opportunity to study there. An improvement in education could change this situation and help the young adults to attend  university and receive the education they deserve. In addition, they will be able to be better tools to foster the economy in the country.",5.17W17 LATs,85026,"I am living in America for about a year and a half,  living with 5 roomates and sharing a room with one of them.

She likes to do outdoors activities and just hanging out with friends. Sariah is from Peru, and she is always dancing bachata and some other latin music. However, even if they are Latin they are white and most of all they love to laugh and to joke with people around them. They also study at the nElc with me and they work at the MTC as custodial.

They tree have served the mission together in Brazil and even if they were from different parts of the USA, they decided to move together at Raintree to study at BYU.

An improvement that I would like to do and I think will help in many ways my city, would be :cheap air-transportation, illegal people that are lower paid and having  more places were people can have fun. Those changes in my opinion will help the economy in my country in many ways and a long-term consequence would be increasing jobs for people and more money in the pocket for all of them.First of all, I believe that would be great to have a cheap air-transportation like in other parts of Italy. In the past, we have had cheap air-transportation and a lot of people that I met in the past, went on different parts of Europe without spending a lot of money. In some part of Europe we have a company that is called ' Ryanair' and it is really cheap comparing with other companies. This company stopped to be in Sardinia and now people who live there, need to pay other companies that are really expensive. One example is that to go to Milan from Munich, would cost 40 dollars or less, but traveling from Milan to Sardinia is going to cost 160 or a price around that. With just this little change is going to help a lot of people in the island to help the economy to increase because seeing that are cheaper tickets they are going to travel more.Another change that I think would be great for the city were I live, will be more places to work. In Italy the economy is going not so good, and there are a lot of people that need a job to mantain their families. However, there are a lot of illegal people that are 'stealing' jobs and they have also do not make a lot of money. For that reason, people in my city can not found a job that is really high or normal paid. This problem is causing a lot of Italian people to earn less money that they should earn and not allowing them to have enough money to finish a month without worring about it. I think that if illegal people should not allow to be paid really a little bit of money, them and Italian people will be able to earn enoughf money for mantain their families.The other change that I would like to make in the city were I live would be create more activities to do. In Sardinia there a lot of realy little cities that sometimes we get bored about because there are not a lot of places were you can go to have fun. Comparing here in Provo there are a lot of places such as minigold, bowling and a lot more. In Cagliari, (Sardinia) there are very less ways to have fun, we just have a place were are a lot of games and another place a little bite far away were are the cinema and some places to eat. Also, there are not a lot of malls, we have a lot of little boutique and just 2 malls that are not really big as in other parts of Italy. I think that if there are going to be more places to have fun for teenagers and more malls, will help people to buy more thing and to increase the economy in the city were I used to live.In conclusion, if this change will be possibily in the island where I used to live, there will be more people that will be allowed to explore different parts of Europe, to have a more open mind and to know other culture. Also having a control of illegal people working in my city will allow all of them and all of Italian people to earn enough money and not be paid lower than they should earn normally for their carreer, additionally the fact of having more places to have fun will help the economy and allowing people to live better.",5.23W17 LATs,75851,"My roomates are pecualiar people. Each of them have their own characteristics and are quite different from the other ones in two important aspects: personality and the way they use their laisure time. The first aspect is about their personalities. For exmaple, Katherine, one of my roomates is studying for becominng an actress. She is outgoing,  loves to talk, tall , always happy and thin. On the other hand, Diana is very shy. She does not like to talk to much with other people. She is chubby, short and has depression. Also, another way that they are different is about the way the spend their free time. To illustrate, Allison loves to espend some free time in the pool, specially after coming home from work at 6pm. On the other hand, Erika,  loves to spend some time reading books in the living room. She is not currentley working, so she stays at home all day long. My roomates are different, but I love spending time with everyone because that is mwhat makes them unique.","Having more libraries in my city will make it a better place to live for people of my age. In big and crowded cities like Lima, Peru,  having libraries are the most important  place that government can build. Thus, there are many beneffits in short and long term for young people of increasing the number of  libraries in Lima. Therefor, having more libraries can help young people to create a habit of reading, help them with their assignment in school or college and allows the  to save money by not buying books that they can rent.First, building more Libraries in Lima will help the youth to create an hanbit of reading.  According to several studies reading helps people, specially in the range of 15-30, to develop their intelligence. As an example, Mexico discovered that having more libraries in its country will make the young people more prone to spend their time in those place.  IF the government can encourage people to reaid they will be having a more prepared mass of work in the future. This goo habit may help people  in short and long terms.Another reason why is so important to have more libraries in my city is because it helps them to do their assignments in school and college. To illustrate, is a student does not have the books that she need to do her homework and their family does no have money to have an internet conection at home, she woukd no have the opportunity to complete her assigments and for that she can have a disadvantage in reference to her classmate, With a library, she can have more access to the information that she needs without any problems. In addition, This helps the youth to be more prepared for their test in school and to have the knowledge that they may need to have better job opportinties in the future.And at last, having more libraries in my Lima allows student to save money by not buying books that they do not have. Renting a book from the library is an important economic help for students. For example, most of the ones who study in college work and study at the same time, and they use their money in paying the tuition for college. Those students are the ones who need the most using the services that the government can give them without any cost, and libraries are not the exception. Also, Saving money for people in tjeir young years is really important because this helps them to avoid debts and student loans. Avoindfing this, will make people more independet with their finances in the future.In conclusion,   to create a habit of reading, help them with their assignment in school or college and allows the  to save money by not buying books that they can rent may help a lot",5.24W17 LATs,23170,"I live in a complexe building with three roomates. They are all americans, caucasian and over twenty-five years old. Their name are Malorie, Brittany and Amy. Brittany and Amy are sisters and Amy is engaged to Malorie's older brother. Amy and Brittany have a brother living in the same complex building, but in the man side.  I moved in last august but they have been living there for about two years now. I descently get along with them, I do not have major issues with them beside the fact that they are noisy, but I tend to believe that it might come from a culture difference. In France we do not slam doors or speak too loud and we have a better consideration of the poeple living in the same house with us, we care about their peace and we are quiet. The exception is if people are celebrating something or if they do not have good manners. Since I am in the country, I got used to use earplugs to be able to sleep or to simply read a book, because seeking for silence became a sport. And I also allow myself to alude this statement because it has happenned with all the roomates I have had since I am in the country. My current roomates are huge fan of superheroes and the appartment is a testimony of it; I would even say that it is a sanctuary. But lately, Amy got married, she moved out and took all her overwhelming superheroes decoration and let us with a blank living room, which is a chance for us to start over.","A beautiful city represents the heart of the people and how we should feel in it. Having a beautiful downtown can make a city more appealing than another one. Some mayors use flowers or different kind of decorations while some prefer to work on the benefits such as free parking lots or an efficient bus system. I tend to believe that in order to feel comfortable in our cities, we do need both. In the city where I come from, two major problems exist and the first one is the abundance of homless people in big places, where we have coffee or restaurant, and the lack of entertaining event. In order to improve my city, the government should get rid of the homeless people living with their dogs and they should organize more events to entertain the community.Homeless people and their dogs do not reflect the beauty of the city. The culture of the country where I come from, people love to spend afternoons or evenings at a coffee or a bar outside simply drinking while talking. It is a good way to socialize and to encompass the vitality of it. The situation becomes less agreable when you are surrounded by homeless people, from any age category, with their dogs, being loud, sometime fighting and not caring about what is going on around them. This make the area not safe at all and it pushes the people and the tourist to stay away from those places, places made to attract them. This situation is becoming bad for the safety of the population and the well-being of the businesses around. With a change coming from the city, it would not only affect the people's lifestyle but also the economy. With more entertaining event in the city, the community would enjoy more and would stay around. We are having a major problem in my city and it is a lack of monthy activity organized by the city, Now we need to organize our own activities instead of having the chance to be in a area where we have to choose. For example, if you are not a fan of going to club but you want to dance, you might have no activity to join and might have to drive to another city to find what you like. If we always move to another area to find what we need, at the end of the day, what about definitively move there? The underlying message is that, we have many events big event in my city and they are najor and gather a lot of people, but the city neglect the little moment we love to spend together and if we could have at least one big thing per month, it would change the dynamism of the population who like to go out and the other moment could be for those when we either want to stay home or just gather in fewer group, but indoor. Given this, having more entertaining event and the homeless people taken care of, will give a chance to a  brand new kind of people of the community to emerge and  to have the desire to be a part of it. With these changes done, the community will feel safer to circulate wherever they want, and families or group of friends will always have something to do if they want to go out for an activity. It is important for the population to express their desires, to the leaders of our city, in order to help them to understand our needs and to make the necessary changes.",5.25W17 LATs,64528,"The people that use to live with are my roomates, Kyle, Bruce, Paco, and Stand.

In many cityes there are many places to have fun, and enjoy time with family and friends, but there are not to many of them, that means that students who live in places without many places to have several activities such as, hike, swim, run, ride a bike, etc., are more able to stress.

On the other hand, if there are not buildings or places to do exercise or distract the mint, students will be more fat, and also boring.Second, sports are necesary on universityes for students to work out and socialize with others. Sports such as, basketball, baseball, football, cyclisim, etc., aloud students to have fun and de stress fro homework and hard work. If a univesity does not have any sport program, the students are going to think twoice if thay want to go to that university. To be in a good shape is parto of de stress, because that will aloud you to think better and act accuracy on situations that maybe you need to think clearely.The only thing that matters in this live is with who are you with.

Having friends with you is the best way to de stress from school, because they will help you to socialize with others and feel better about yourselve. Also, is very important to have good and smarth friends. Even if they are crazy and like to have fun, they must be smarth on classes if you want it to be like them.In sumary, there are many things that a student need to have happines and good notes at university but, having special places to have fun, practice sports, and enjoy time with friends are the key to have succes at univesity.

People in this city have problems to study at the university for different factors. Young people can revieve more benefits if the goverment do something to find a solution. People in Arequipa can be benefit because, they will not go to other city to study, they will save money and they will recieve education witthout problrmd.    People in Arequipa used to go to other city to revieve education. They need to move to other city because they do not have the facility to study in their own city.This is not comfortable for people because they need to leave their familes. They need to start a new life in a place totally different. If Arequipa had have more universities it will not be a problem. For example, Luccas wish to study in the university. He went to other city to study, and he started to have depression because he missed his famiyly and friends. It is a result because he moved to other country. Arequipa needs to have more universiies to make people feel more comfortabble when ther want to study in the university.    As a result of people move to other city, they will spend more money. Studying in other city gives to people more barriers to reach their goals. They will not spend more money because they will live far away of home. They  need to pay for a home and food. They will also get problems because of that. People used to quit of the university because of this reason. They will not have enough of money to paty their tuttions.

Because of this,  she can not pay next semester in the university. She got this problem because she does not have enough of money. As a result, people spend a lot of money stying in other city.     Finally, people because of all of these problems do not study. People made the decision for not studying because it is the most easy. Sometimes they do not have the facilities to go to other country to study. They start to work or do other things. They lost the opportunity to get education because of that. For example, Ross wants to study, but she does not have enough money to go to other city. She will start to do other things and los the opportunity to study just because Arequipa does not have a university. That is why, Arequipa need to have universities to give the opportunity to people to study.       Arequipa needs to have univerty to help young people to be better.

Most of these people are college students. As part of their life as a student, they want to have fun, but when it comes to entertainment, the city lack options, having only pubs, restaurants and night clubs.To improve the city and make it better for people at their 20s, the administration of the city has to bring more recreational places because people will have more options and will be more phisically active.Building more recreational places int the city, such as paintball, archery tag, trampolin places and courts, will provide the inhabitans, especially those on their 20s more opportunities to have fun. The city in the way it is now, does not have many options. The ones that it has are always related with parties and shows where people get drunk. Providing more options event to those that do not drink or do not like parties will help to create a different culture for these people. They will see that rather than going to a pub and getting drunk, they have different options in which they can enjoy their time with friends in many activities. For that the administration of the city or investors could use the natural resources that the city has, such as its rivers, forests and mountains.Another reason why building these places will be benefitial for people is that they will be more active, practicing more sports. This practice will help them to be heathier and avoid many diseases. Many health problems are related to the lack of exercise. The options that people in Patos de Minas have now do not offer exercises, just sitting with friends and drinking. Offering more options will help to change this culture, improving their health and their habits. Of course that if they go to those places is a matter of choice, but if they do not have the option, there is no way to choose it.Improving people's lives through recreational places help them to be healthier and to have more options of what to do for entertainment.

First, my wife is my best friend, my companion, and is my motivation when the things are not good. She is a Secretary for profession but today she works a lot in our house, I admire her for that. Whit her I can talk about all and she always have a nice word for me. Second, my children. They are my purpose of life because in them I can see the future of this world. They are students, and they are good students, that is enough for me. Sometimes they are a little hiperactive but I love them. They give live and color of our home. Third, my dog. His name is Samy and he is our complement. Today he doesn't live with us because he is in Chile, but we will see again in three more weeks. He is our best friend, even tought he doesn't speak but we can feel his love for us. In summary, I live with my family and they are, include our dog, the most important for me today.","I love my city because has a great weather and has a lot of beach. The name of my city is Antofagasta and is in the north of Chile. Always is spring and the people is nice with others. When I think in my city or how my city could be a better place for live, I think that only two changes Antofagsta could be the best city in Chile for people of my age; this two changes are transportation and environment.First, transportation. Today in Antofagasta the public transportation is bad, old and the trips are slow and longer. Nowadays you take a bus in your house and you need to travel for at least one hour for arrive to the center of the city.  Antofagasta is like Chile thing and large, will be easy to have a subway for example and the public transportation only would move the people between their homes until the central line of subway. The people don't need invest a lot of time in trips and they could enjoy more time with their families. The quality of life will be improve.Second, environment. Antofagasta is in Atacama dessert, the most arid of the world. It is very hard to have parks or a lot of trees because we don't have enough water for that, but we can find other solutions. It is important have good places for our children, places for the families with games for children and machines for practice exercises for example. I know it is a hrad work but we need to find solutions. Today is common use syntetic grass. A great solution could be to have paks with syntetic grass and public pools. Maybe is expensive but you need less money for manain it. We need more public spaces for share with our friends and family. With this invest we could have a better society, more happy and with less stress. In conclusion, if my city, Antofagasta could be improve the transportation and the environment will be the best city for live for people like me. In my opinion, with these two changes we could have a better society, a better city, a better quality of life. In summary a great city.",5.32W17 LATs,00497,"A few years ago my parents use to serve as directors for an orphanage organization in Ecuador. There people from North America, on its most, use to come to stay at our house for three weeks. They would come to give service to children that lived in orphanages. The age range for the groups that we use to receive were between eighteen and twenty five year old girls. As they reacently finished their high school, they still had a teeanger like behaviour. All of them were loving and fun. Sometimes we would be facing big problems or dramas at home, but it was usual, so we didn't loose control. They had a curfew and rules they had to follow, otherwise they would have been dismissed and sent back home. Some of the rules were to not become very close to the workers at the organization, to not go walking outside without a companion, and to not caress male children older than seventeen. I was fifthteen years when all this experience came to its end and the organization close because of the lack of applicants when the church changed the age for people to go out on their missions. Despite the rules at the place, it was fun and safe. A great experience I am grateful for.","Cities are places surrounded by many people with needs, but are we targeting everyone's needs? I would opine that the teeange population or people under 28 years, need to spend time differently than older aldults. They need to do things differently, to advantage their energy at that age and save good memories. This does not mean they have to become ruleless or uncontrollable. The world is becoming a place full of people with many illnesses, bad communication and negative thinking. Exercise has been shown to improve a person's performance in many areas. Areas such as physical health, emotional and mental health and inclusively as self steem booster to be more confident. If exercise is what the population needs, gyms around my town should be build more and more. Also, there should be exiting classes poeple want to attend and the gym brand owner should make those classes avalible for free at least for the first three weeks of the customer.First, gyms in my town would be a great improvement because it can help with physical health. If we have great physical health we are able to do things more agily. We are able to mantain good blood circulation and a good posture. All of these features, help our inner body keep working adequately and reduces the risk of illness. Second, gyms in my town would be a great improvement because it can help with emotional help. As the body releases toxings and burns unnecesary fats, it becomes more relaxed and strong. A person who exercises is happier than one who doesn't because all that negative enrgy can come out through exercercise. When a person takes action and decisions if relaxed and is grounded  they are more likely to do the right choice, making them happier. Exercise can help a person with deppression focus on multiple tasks, they need to achive, and make them forget their own problems. Third, gyms in my town would be a great improvement because it can boosts people confidence. Confidence is born within one, so you can either decide or not to have the right mentality, or at least that is what many say. As my way of viewing it, I think it is not compleatly true. I think good looking persons are more approachable and they know this, so they end up interacting with more people. Eskepticals would question what about introverts who would rather spend time on their own than in company. I would say that exercise as mentioned previously can help with emotional and brain health, making them more aware of their action. As an example, someone who has been improving their breathing through exercise for many weeks and practices guitar, will be able to be relaxed and focused on their ability withn the instrument. As long as the exerciser rests well, eats properly, and exercises they can become healthier and happier.In conclusion exercise serves to us, the young and also the older population improve our living.

Living with them is being, to be honest, quite an adventure.  Furthermore, I do not know them, their culture is differente, their language, the way they are, and even the food they eat. However, the fact that they are different does not allows me to judge, so I did not judge them, we have our differences; in a lot of things we do not think on the same way, still we know how to cope with each other. Even though we are from different countries and backgrounds, we still learned to be polite and respectful. Additionally, I live with my sister that is a plus, and I share room with her that is even better. I have been sharing room with my sister since I was little I am used to it, so living with strangers it has not been that bad because I do not see them everyday at every hour. Nevertheless, the few moments I have spent with my roommates I have realized that they are not bad people, they are nice and is fun to be around them.

Therefore, everything in Monterrey is upside down right now, and a consequence of the security being week is that the youth stopped caring about their aducation. For example, instead of being in the school they are drinking and smoking with their friends, and they are not afraid because they know that the police will not do anything. That is why Monterrey needs an improvement on the security.So the improvement that Monterrey needs would be more and better security, more police officers that are fit, and that will know what to do in a dangerous situation. Also, Monterrey needs police officers that are fit, not police officers that are in bad shape and just are eating in their working hours. Because if they are not fit then they will not be able to chase after the delincuent, also it is more probable for them to die because they will not be ready if there is a gunshot. Considering the fact that it is really dangerous to be in the strees at night, pople can say that there needs to be an improvement on the security that Monterrey has.Furthermore, the security needs to be honest. For example, nowadays they police officers accept bribe. Instead of giving the consequence to the citizen that broke the law, the police officer just ask the citizen for money or something that he wants, and then let him free. That is just unfair and wrong, the person broke the law; stil they let him free. An overcome of thit decisions is that poeple would never want to obey and follow the law because they know that there will not be punishment. In addition, they will stop respecting the law. That is why the goverment should fired those police officers that accept bribe.The final point, is that the security needs to be more prepare. For example, if there is a situation that requieres police officers they should: firstly arrive on time to the place they need to be. Secondly, they should have a plan in order to know what they are going to do when they arrive and when they face the delincuents. Additionally, they need to know what to do with the delicuents. So, from the beginning till the last moment of the situation they need to know what to do. An overcome of that is that, if they know what to do, they will be prepare, and they will know what to do and will not face any surprises.To sum everything up, Monterrey needs an improvement on the security. It needs to be more fit, more honest and more prepare. So, that in the future, the people would not be scared of being outside their house at any time of the day or night.",5.35F15 LATs,91714,"When I was living at the MTC I had to live with missionaries from different backgrounds, cultures, and  nations too.

I would say that my time with these people was  good and unforgettable because If hadn't lived with them, I wouldn't have had this experience of living with people form other countries. I always respected them in spite of our differences, actually I focused more on the similarities rather than on the differences  because we all are children of Christ and we all have the potential to succeed and progress in life. Focusing on the similarities helped me to develop humility and kindness.  I am extremely grateful for that experience that I had.","Puebla is a lovely and beatiful place to live. It has some many churches, archaeological sites and green areas too. Young people comprises the majority of the population in that city. The proposals that should be implemented are to invest more money in education, help young people to develop their talents, and stop discrimintationFirstly, education is crucial for everyone because with education we can acquire and gain knowledge. However, the government is so unethical and unfair, all the politicians want to to earn a lot of money withou doing anything, that affects the economy of not just a city or state but also the whole country. The state government should raise awareness of this problem. Furthermore, there are many skilled and talented people who were born in in my hometown. Nevertheless, the had to leave the state because they were seekinfg for opportunities to prosper and succeed, but they were not able to receive any support from the government. These people went to countries such as: USA, United Kingdom, Spain, and so forth. It is heartbreaking and devasting to see that all these  great and wonderful people are leaving. The government should stop stealing money because thess actions that they are doing are not going to take my hometown to a good place. To sum up, education has to be provided to everyone equally and the government  needs to invest the money that they have wisely.Secondly, there used to be a organization that helped  young people with special abilities and skills, but unthankfully the local government decided to close this place permanently, they said that they were spending a significant amount of money on this intitution. Moreover, many people went on strikes protesting and complaing about this issue because the government close this place without telling people before hand. Unfortunately the school that was  for people with special abilities is the house of one of the people who works in the government, that is completely unfair. In summary, the government should open the school again because all the people with special abilities and skills deserve to develop and reine their skills.Discrimination is a bifg problem too because there are some young  people  that discriminate the people that work in the the rural areas, they should stop doing that because we all are the same, we all have the same rights and responsibilities as Mexican citizens, if the youth treat the farmers correctly erverything will be better.

I share the house with my brother, and for me it is a pretty nivce place to live. I decided to move to Orem for a very precise reason and that one is: that i like to have a big space to live freely and not crowded in a small apartment as much of the students live here. Furthermore, having a regular house help you to learn more about how to take care of a home and some other activities related to household care.In contrast with small apartments regular homes are free of roomates , that let you have total freedom to decorate or arrange the furniture as you prefer to do it. However, the thing that I miss of living in those small and crowden complexes. is that you can make a lot of friends very easily and there always parties to attend.

My city is a very colonial city because it was developed during the spanish reign in Mexico. Wich has many green areas because also it is an agricultural city, and a hill in the downtown of the city, make Atlixco the main target for many national and international travelers. However, it is necessary to develop some changes into the city image to make it more enjoyable for the tourist and for the residents of the city. one of the improvements that I would suggest to the city council is to take in consideration is to develop a city trail, For this i mean a trail for hikers and runer that go all across the city like the ones that many cities in the Unites States has. the reason for developing this idea is because it will generate many important benefits for the city and their people.       The first reason is since Atlixco is a very colonial and historical city and having a trail that go all around the city it will be easy to show many important landmarks and hystorical places to the people who visit the city, and also make more enjoyable the hike or run for those who were exersising over the trail. because it much better runinng or walking with a magnificent landscape that in a treadmill at home.        The second reason is  the visible benefit will be that many people will be encouraged to workout, and have healtier lifestyles, for example: places who have city trails for people  such as New York or Chicago. report to have happier citizens that enjoy going for a walk four to five times a week. that obviously produce an increase on the productivity of the people who are more happier and work more efficiently. also it will be benefitial for my city because Mexico struggle with obesity (actually we held the second place of children obesity in the world). Furthermore, this project will be a perfect strike infavor of public health, making the city government gain recognition for their apportation to solve the problem.   The Third benefit will be to present the city as place where people like to excersive and have a healthy life styles, because places like this are very desirable to live , will increase the real state value of the properties of the city. and according to real state specialist, the price of land can increase at least 7% when there are sport related infraestructure near them. Finally, taking action will benefit everyone in Atlixco, it will promote the city residents hapiness, will make the city even more attractive for tourism, will help with the healt national crissis, and will help to raise the land value in the city. this smart movements only provide benefits and no disadvantages , so it will be a smart move from the city council if they start thinking in the benefit of teh city and do something good for it. and im sure if the do this they will 'make Atlixco great again!'.",5.46F15 LATs,11544,"There are just three people who I live here since I came to the US and off coure, they are my roomates.

Ecuador has many problems in it, which have made people go out from their houses and march against laws which are affecting them in different ways. Even though there are a high percentage of people who are in favor of those laws, most people believe that Ecuador will be a better place to live if the government would change the laws reducing the taxes for imports,  and giving help to those who want to start businesses.The first reason that will help the country of Ecuador to improve is by reducion the imports' taxes. the word 'Imports' is related with all the products manufactured in different countries and try to enter in the territory. Ecuador is a small country with a lot of laws, and every President of the Republic has been creating more and more laws which are affecting the induntry there. In addition, Ecuador is a developing country that needs a good administration  in order to progress and succeed. However, those laws against imports are affecting the industry because they do not have the economic sources to import products which are going to cost three times more if are from other countries. For instance, a textile company wanting to improve their knowledge in the quality of products send a great team to gather the knowledge in other country, as a result they need to import a machine which will help them in their purpose to have good quality produts; in addition, this company will need a lot of money if they want to import the machine because of the laws which will be almost impossible for new companies . Although the country is getting the money from those taxes, they are not helping in the growth of the industry. Because of the benefit will have the industry part in the country, most people believe that the best improvement will be that government reduces the taxes from imports.The final reason that will help Ecuador to improve is the correct economy managment foccussed in helping those companies which are starting from the bottom. It is a common knowledge that the problem Ecuador is suffering and the reason why Ecuador is stucked as a developing countries is because they do not have enough progress in the industry part. In addition, the country is investing a lot in things which are not neccesary, and as a common rumor many peoplr think the government is taking their money to become rich people. Therefore, most of people are waiting for the next electoral elections in order to kick the president out, due to the fact that even though the country has been creating protests, these have not been making any effect because the president has the army custodiating him. In fact, the reason why people is with this attitute is because they do not receive help from the government when they want to start something. For example, if someone wants to start a restaurant, that person needs to create documents which will allow he or she to start the business; those documents take so long, more than 6 months if the person does not do brabery. Also, these people who are starting business need to be prepared to spend too much money without loans if they want to import any product from other countries; also if they participate in a loan, they problably will need to pay the amount by four times more. The solution will be the facilitation of getting a loan for those who are starting businesses, and also the help from the government by changing the law.Even though the country is giving loans with high interest rates, I believe that the best solution to improve Ecuador is to help those companies which are starting.In conclusion, because of the benefits Ecuador will has if help those companies which are starting, and reduxing taxes, I believe the best improvement",5.46W17 LATs,83588,"The complex that I live right now is called Liberty Squre.

As a result, people need place to build lots of bulidings to solve the population problem for citizen to live or work there. Wherease, tall buildings limited natural environment such as park. Therefore, if my city can extain the park area will be helpful for people because it can reduce risk of disease, connect nature, and to excercise,  easpecially for the people in my age.First, the explored city have lots of polution problem which cause some physical diseases for the people. However, if we have a park which has lots of trees and plants will decrease some air polution. Furthermore, the park will brings fresh air to the city and makes it clean. The people in my age need a health body to do the things that they want to do, they need numerous energy to sustain their bodies. Thus, if the city is able to make a park wider and fulfille with tress will be an useful environment for those people.          Second, the park provides a place which can let the people have space to connect to the natural system and closer to the origin. For example, people nowadays are rely on electronic eqiupment all the time. They did not notice that those technology is taking away their ability of imagination because technology is too convenience for people to search infomation instead of creating by yourselves. On the other hand, if people are willing to spend time in a park and have interaction with natural environment, they can broud their capacity of imagination and improve themselves.Last, the wide park build a healthy place wich can let people to exercise. The people in my age, they are sledom to move their body because they have the reason that there is no place to do excercise. However, if the city can have a place which can encorage people to have time and motivation to excercise will be good to people. Because of our society, people are lack of knowlege that they should work out outdoor instead of indoor which follows the instructions of Television excercise vedio. The outdoor activities motivates people to have true excercise with sun, air, and natural system. Therefore, a park will benefit people not only their phsical bodies but also mental spirit.In conclusion, the improvement of building a park will let people have energy, connect natural system, and have a place to excercise. The three reasons which will brings the people in my age to improve themselves and have a healthy quality in their lives.",5.49W17 LATs,07467,"I have been living with my extended family since I came to The United States.

Although it is a small city, there are a lot of traffic accidents. A lot of young people have their own cars. Having a car is a magnific opportunity that young people have; however, they do not appreciate it as they should. Young people spend a lot of time looking at their cellphone while driving, therefore, a lot of car accidents happen. Something that could be done in order to make the city a better place to live for young people would be banninng cellphone usage while driving.       The inmediate consequence of banning cellphones would be preventing car accidents. If young people do not use their cellphones while driving, a lot of car accidents would be prevented. A lot of times, when a car is hit, it is not that persons's fault. It is the other driver's because they were using their phones and driving ant the same time.  In this city on the south of the country, cellphones are not completely banned while driving. Although there are numerous cellphone use constraints, young people do not follow those rules. Instead, they think that they are more cool because they can drive and text at the same time.    One of the long-term consequences would be helping  young people to not being addicted to their phones; and if they are, to gradually eliminate it. Most young people are addicted to their phones and that is why they use it all the time. Young drivers know that they are putting their life at risk and the life of people around them; however, they do not leave their cellphones to the side. Instead they keep using it because they believe that they are capable enough to do two things at the same time. Cellphone adiction is one of the most common adictions among young people that also affects people around them.      Cellphone usage while driving should be banned in order to improve the quality of live among young people. One of the long-term consequences this could draw is eliminate young people's addiction towards their cellphone. However, if we want to talk about the short-term consequences, there would be a lot between th most important ones is preventing car accidents.

Due to hard traffic and specific location on bottom of mountains the city suffers from air pollution. Transformation of public transport from gas to electricity or hybrid solutions will help to eliminate this problem. Therefore, air pollution reduction will make Almaty better place to live because of less health problems, clean air is basis for future generations, and green technologies.    One reason why air pollution reduction will make Alamty better place to live is because people will face less health problems. It is obvious that due to lack of clean air people suffers from many respiratory diseases. For example, hard air pollution can be reason of cancer. Furthermore, dust air increase chances to get an allergy.  For this reason air pollution reduction would benefit for my genereation.    Another reason that elimination of air pollution problem will make Almaty better place to live because clean air is important for future generations. Resolving situation with air pollution will help to grow healthier generation of citizens. To illustrate, pollutants that exist in an air influence all aspects of life such as reproduction activity. This problem lead to decreasing of number of people who can have children. Clearly, clean air is a basis for future generations.    Finally, air pollution reduction will make Almaty better place to live because of green technologies. Increasing role of green technology if one of the dominant factors to chose place to live. Current generation is considering green technologies impact while choosing the place to live.

I think one improvement that would be good in Neuquen is  to have more recreation centers.      First of all, recreation center can add more activities to Neuquen. My city is a nice place with a large population. It is the capital of the Patagonia. All the students from the south of Argentina go to Neuquen to study in the university. There are a lot of students there.  The only problem is that students don't have to much to do. The city needs more enterteinment options for the youth. Options that are no very expensive and good at the same time. A place where youth can play sports or improve their artist skills, or with music.  Therefore, a recreation center can add the activities that the city offers to the students.     Second, a recreation center can decrease the delinquency. There are a lot of youth that don't attend to the school or don't work. Most of these kind of youth don't received support of their parents. A negative consequence of this is that youth go outside to stole, bother people, and consume drugs. A recreation center would help these youths to use they free time in something good. Most of them have really good qualities in sports, but they don't have the sources to play or someone that help them improve their abilities. Therefore, a recreation center can decrease the delinquency.     Third, a recreation center can help to reduce stress in youth. Being a student can be stressful, especially when youth don't know how to manage the stress. A recreation center could be a really good place for youth to release their stress by doing diverse activities. A recreation center that offers different activities would be a place that can help students to socialize and meet new people with their same interests. A recreation center with activities without  alcohol or drugs, with health enterteinment would be a good place for youth. Therefore, a recreation center can hel to reduce stress in youth.     In conclusion, a city where there are a lot of youth that can't provide a good environment for youth to spend a productive time is a city that youth can't enjoy. For these reasons,  a recreation center in the city of Neuquen can add more activities, decrease the delinquency and reduce the stress in youth.",5.53W17 LATs,54856,"My family is very important for me.

Many people outside the country believe that it is the capital because its beauty and structure. There are many people who believe that Heredia is the perfect place to live. Even though my city is a really good place to live and visit, it would be better if it can help adult people to learn English. With some significant programs, the city, not only can help young people to learn English, but also adult people. When adult people learn English, they will help the tourist to fill confortable, they can work for international companies, and give more resources to local government. First, my city could be better when adult people learned English because they can help the tourists to enjoy the city. Each year, my city recieve more than million visitors from the United States. Because they do not speak Spanish, sometimes it is hard for them to communicate and enjoy the city. Unfortanaly, many adult people do not speak English. Even though that they want to help them, they do not know to do it, they tryied, but it is not enough to help the visitor to feel confortable. However, if our people learn basic English like how to give directions, or have a short converstations, that could make a huge different with the tourits. Thus, it is important the local government promotes that adult people learn English to speak with the visitors. Second, if people from my city speak English, more international companies could establish in town. Costa Rica has many international companies that came to make businesses. Unfortanally, my city only have few of them because we do not have enough people who speak English, and it is required to work with them. However, when people in my city achieve a medium level, they can start working with this companies, if other companies belief that we have enough people with English skills, they will come to our city and help our people to have a better jobs. With these better jobs, people would have more for their families. Therefore, it is important to develop a program that helps people to learn English that help them to get to these international companies. Third, if people have better jobs, they will pay more taxes to help the city to have more resources. If people get better jobs, they will pay more taxes and the local government will have more resources. With these money, they can build better infraestructure in the city. For example, there are many streets that need be repaired, with these money, they can do it as soon as posible. Also, they can build new hotels or parks to promote more tourism. Therefore, my city will be better when its people speak English and pay more taxes because they new jobs.To conclude, if people from my city learn how to learn English, they will help my city to be better. They can help the tourist, they can have better jobs, and have more money to pay taxes and give more sources to local government. This is not a easy task, but it could be possible if they start now. They can start with something simple, and with time, tryieng to get more further. They can join effort with Goverment to receive extra help.

Like all the cities in the world, my hometown has both positive and negative characteristics. Vladikavkaz is surrounded by the beautiful Caucas Mountains, so the citizens always have beautiful sights and places to go hiking, camping, and spending time together. However, I wish my city would give people of my age more options to do sports.Vladikavkaz's sport community is famous of its well-known wrestlers, but that is all it has. I believe that building more parks, workout zones, and bike laines would increase the number of sports people like to do and the number of those who do sports. As a consequence, Vladikavkaz and Russia as well will give a chance to more people to develop their skills and to take a part in different competitions in different disciplines. As a long-term effect, the Russian Federation will earn more Olympic Games medals in the future. A few changes  in a small city might cause a great effect on the sport community of the whole country.Furthermore, if more people will start to do more excercises, workout and prefer bikes instead of the cars, environment of the city will change in a good way. Children and adults will be healthier. Some will influence others with their example to choose sports. In my opinion, it will also have positive effect on the number of smokers and alcohol drinkers and will decrease it. Sport makes people happier and decrease the number of people suffering from stress and depression.  Also, that is a fact that bikes do not pollute the air and increase the health level in the city. In addition, city with such a good environment will attract more tourists.To make Vladikavkaz's citizens healthier, happier and to help the city and the whole country in achieving good sports result, the government of the city should make only one improvement. They need to make Vladikavkaz a place in which people, who like to do sports, will have all what they require to excercise and workout. I know that the budget of my hometown is very small, but I also believe that small improvements will have great consequences for many generations of the Vladikavkaz's citizens, so it worth it.",5.56F15 LATs,13586,"I share my room with another person, but sometimesI feel that I do not have a roommate at all.

We have a lot of universities; however, we do not have campus for them. They are spread along the city, and the students have to travel long hours to study every day.  Campus for colleages would be an improvement that would benefit young people for two main reasons, they would not have to travel long distances to study and also they would have more resources to help them in their studies. First, young people would not have to travel long distances to study if they had a campus in their respectives universities. It is not something universities have in Argentina. Students do not have apartments to live close to colleage. This generates that students have to travel and spend hours per day just to go to colleage and go back home. Furthermore, the time they loss traveling they could spend it studing or working. Many students do not have a chance to work while they are studying even when they need it because they do not have time. University students are the future of every country, and society; hence, the goverment should invest on them and their future. Building campus for universities is one of the solutions, many countries already have them. Buenos Aires should learn from those countries and improve the education ambience. In addition to this point, If students have university campus they will have more resources to help them in their studies. Campus not only provide where to live, but also provide more resources as libraries, groups of study, bookstores, and extracurricular activities. Students need of those resources to have a better education. Many times students who do not have these tools provided by their universities have to go and search fot them in other places, apending much more money. Furthermore, campus provide also an ambience perfect for study and improve. Being srrounded by other students, by teachers, by resources that are there to help them, students can have a better performance and a better experience.  Campus also provide jobs which are close to classes and that can be adjust to your classes schedule. There are many resources that campus provide to students, students in Buenos Aires need them in order to improve their performance. In conclusion, there are some improvements that must be done in my city, and one of them that would benefit people from my age is the construction of university campus. Young people should be dedicated and spend their time in what really matters: studying and sometimes working for paying their studies. Nevertheless, they cannot do that if they spend the majority of their time traveling. Campus can benefit students with many tools that would help them with their performance.",5.58F15 LATs,80420,"Recently, I moved to Cenntennial Apartments in Provo, Utah.There I live with roomates.

She knows how to play the violin and the piano. It is a blessing for us in the apartment having her as a roomate. We can hear classical music during the day.

It is rich in flora, fauna and architecture. However, not everything is happiness in this town. Youth and all the community are being affected for the public transportation. This is not efficient at all; the buses and the vans are old, they are always late and most the bus drivers are not certificated to drive the buses. Public transportation in Patzcuaro need to improve, this would be benefitial for the students, for the workers and for teh economy of the town. First, having an efficient tranportation will help students to tranport to their schools without problems. Patzcuaro,  is a little town in Michoacan. The transportation is not efficient and the quality of the cars is bad. In the town there are not schools, the schools are located outside the town aproximatly 20 min far away. In the morning most of the students have to wake up early, in order to attend their schools. Everyday they have to use public tranportation to travel to their schools. However, this tranportation is not efficient. Although, not all the buses or vans are old, some of them don't have good conditions. Morover, students  have to wait for a long time in the morning waiting for them. If the public tranportation improve students will be able to be on ther classes on time, and they would have more time to do their homework. Second, workers would be beneficiated for a better public transportantion. Basicly, the main problem of the public transportation is the time that people have to wait for it. People have to be earlier in the stop bus in order to wait for the bus, howver,  the bus is never on time and sometimes is full with people from other town. This is problem because people don't know when is the correct moment for waiting for the bus. For this reason, sometimes people is late at their work; this causes less salary, more problems and that sometimes they have to work extra hours to finish their duties. Workers are not able to work extra hours because probably they are not going to find a bus after their work. If public tranportation improves, people would be able to take laboral decisions and they would be able to earn more money, because they would feel confident that they will find a bus after their work.Finally, having a better public transportation will help to improve the economy of the town. This would be beneficial for the young and the ederly population. Patzcuaro is a touristic site in Michoacan, people from all over the worl come to visit this place. If the tranportation conditions improve, tourism will come more frecuently and more easily to the town. As a consequence, the economy will imporve in the comunity. As a conclusion, there are some things that are vital for the community. Public transportation is one of them. It is vital to have good and efficient public transportation. This is the 'soul' of the town. If the transportation improve, the community would get a lot of benefits. Directly, they wil improve in the  academic, profesional and economic areas. It is important that the government can make changes in the community and they can address this issue, because it is government responsability to improve community conditions, and to have ' their people' to have a better life. Patzcuaro needs a better public transportation. It is a bias that can't wait anymore.

Furthermore, during our time together as companions, since we had the same aims and aspirations - to be obedient and serve the Lord with all our heart, mind, soul, and power -, we supported each other in our attempts of accomplishing those goals. To illustrate, we always used to listen to gospel songs together. Next, we used to eat healthly by buying vegetables and fruits.

Therefore, before beginning to find solutions for all topics, policy makers should analyze what of all those issues should be considered at first, that is, what of them may bring more impactful implications to society in a short and long-term consequences. Thus, as everyone knows, the future of any nation is shaped by their young generation. Because most of them are university students, some initiatives should be done in order to protect and facilitate their lives. For this reason, increasing the number of police officers is a vital improvement because it helps students to profoundly focus on their university and study with more efficiency.      Increasing the number of police officers will help students to deeply focus on their study. College time is a stressful time. Young adults not just need to attend to an exaustive study routine but also take care of their on basic needs such as dieting, house organization, laundry, job, and bills. Being worry with life risk because violence outside campus negatively interfers on their learning process. To illustrate, because students need to worry about coming back home safety, their mind do not have space to plan the next day, so when they get home, they start using the time they could be studying and preparing to go to bed to do what they could do if they felt safe outside campus. For some students, coming back home takes about one hour. For these reasons, the presence of a greater sum of police officer inside and outside campus could help students to concentrate deeper on school.     Having a greater quantity of police officers would help students to study with more efficiency. We are in the technology time. Every university relies on information system to employ their learning process. To illustrate, students do not give to their teacher assingments or research papers physicaly anymore: they send to them though e-mail. Thus, the use of eletronic devices such as computers, Ipads, laptops, notebooks, and even cellphones are essential to save time and therefore do more thing in less time. As a result, without safety, students cannot rely on those devices. Therefore, they do not performe as great as they could.

However, the experience of living there and the impact of the city in young people could be better if we had more libraries, and if in the school and home, teachers and parents would encourages the young adults to read.  Invest money in libraries and education  would carry a huge improvement in people's life now and in the future. If there were more libraries young people could use their time in a more productive way, the crimes rates could be go low and in a long term we could have a more educated generation with more critical ideas that would help the entire society and my city and country could be, finally, a better place.First, most of young people spend all their leisure time with friends in the streets or locked in their homes playing video games. This is not a problem by itself, but when these are the only activities to wich young people dedicate their lifes, the situation could become a problem. If more libraries and educative places would be build, and the young people were concious of the importance of education, they would spend more time learning about a lot of important things that could help them to be better citizens and to discover what they want to do for the rest of their lifes. Therefore, the leisure time could go from useless activities to something that really help them.In the same way, with more espaces like libraries, young people would spend more time indoors instead of in the streets, bored, trying to do something exciting- that is not always legal- or being influenced by older people who only want to take advantage of the influenciable minds of teenagers and young adults. It is in the streets and with bad companions that most of yong people get into bad habits such as drink alcohol frequently, star to use illegal drugs. Besides, those bad habits usually lead people to the delinquence and crime, be that for fun, because they are not aware of what they are doing when are under the effect of those things or simply to get money to buy more alcohol or drugs. Thus, a simple thing as keep the youngs occupied doing good activities, could improve the life all of the community by reducing the crime rates.Another reason to build more libraries and enhance the education in young people is that they would earn more knowlegde  and could be more councious of our country's situation, leading them to take better decision, to be better citizens to be aware of the people and conditions around them and maybe could make them want to do something for other persons and for the place where they live. My city needs a generation that makes the difference and the education is the better way to achieve that.In conclusion, one of the better things that could be done to improve the live of people of my age in the place where I live, is to build more places where young people could go to learn and to have a good time. This is because they would be better persons, and young people could improve individually and as a part of a community.

My mother is tall, white, brunette, and quite shy, just as me.  My mom has interest on the science field. Thus, she decided to be a nurse, which she actually employs now. She always watches TV shows related to medicine or health topics.  Every time that she came out from work she would cook for me and my siblings. She would always show her love for us with her food. In fact, she would always try to show her love, not only with food, but also with actions. My siblings,  both are men, and I used to find it very interesting because our personalities were very different. My siblings would always talk about girls and cars, while I would talk about boys and clothing. Even though, we had very different interests, we shared our love for Biology. Ever since I can remember my siblings and I would wait for our mom to come home so that we could all watch health related TV shows. My siblings and I were on the same school. Therefore, we had the same schedule. However,  during the afternoon they went to football practice and I went to softball practice.","Chihuahua is a medium-sized city, in which people can find a few activities to do. Although, the population has grown exponentially, the amount of activities one can do is limited. People can go to the cinema, park, restaurants, mall, but nothing else. Growing with only those activities makes you get used to it. however, going into different cities made me ponder that having a theme park would change things for the better due to the fact that theme parks would give more options for people my age to do on their leisure time. Therefore,  having a theme park would bring many benefits to our city. Firstly, having a theme park would inmediately bring more turism to our city. Turism is one of the sources that Mexico uses to maintain its economy. However,  Chihuahua does not have a variety of turistic places. Hence, building an amusement park would bring people from around this city such as,  Texas, Coahuila, New Mexico, Durango, among other places into the city. Moreover, people my age have a hard time planning fun activities due to the fact that the list is very limitied; thus, people my age always ends up doing the same things. However, if a theme park is built in this city, on the long-term the economy of Chihuahua would increase exponentially, because many people would go and spend money on this theme park. Another reason why a theme park would be an incredible idea is because families would have the opportunity to spend real quality time. Just as in other places of Mexico, having a theme park has strengthened family bonds. Mexico City's theme park called ' Las ferias de Chapultepec' not only has it brought turism into the city, but also it has made leisure time way more fun. Families can go and spend time with their children in relaxed attractions and shows, but also friends can go and experience real adrenaline on the rollercoasters that this park has. However, not all people from Chihuahua and near this city can go all the way to ' Las ferias de Chapultepec' because it would take a 24 hours ride. Thus, having a theme park would make citizens in Chihuahua have more fun activities near the place they live in.All in all,  finding a way of building a theme park in Chihuahua, would be a great investment  that would benefit not only citizens, but also our country's economy. Theme parks would bring turism into the city making our economy increase and more people want to come and visit this beautiful city. Moreover, the benefits of having a theme park in Chihuahua would go beyond increasing the economy in our country. It would simply benefit its own citizens by providing more leisure activities which in the long- term will make  Chihuahua a happierplace with more turism.",5.81F15 LATs,91848,"The people I live with are American persons.

Something I love about them is their personalities because they are sociable, friendly, lovely, kind and have service for others. Living with them has been an unique experience not only because I can feel a love family, but also because they are a good example in my life. I admire their dedication in the different activities they have to achieve during the day. In addition, having their protection and love makes me feel safe and loved. I have a strong feeling of love for this family, they are my angels. When people make efforts, dedication, have perseverance and diligence to make you feel as If you were at home,  those things are valuable and will be valuable for the rest of your life.","One improvemet that would make my city a better palce to live for people my age is academies of different languages.   The main reasons are because this can empower the economy in El Salvador, develop skills and dicrease violence. Firstly, learning different types of languages can empower the economy in my city. Economy is an important factor if people want to have a better place to live.  Languages are universal tools that can develop systems and strategies to have a better quality in the economy.  If people learn languages, especially English, they would have greater career opportunities, job performances and better relations with different kind of companies, nationally or internationally. Nowadays, languages are changing the world completely because the countries have exterior relationships with different kind of countries. Acquaring knowledge about the benefits of the link between languages and economies can change the point of view in thousand of people. Languages can give the opportunity to develop different skills in different areas. Individuals would be more likely to have a higher IQ and EQ because their brains will start working more and spreading more chemicals. Leaning a new language is not an easy goal because languages have different grammar, lexic and strategies to write. However, because of those levels of difficulty , people will be able to analize and use the logic even more.  The brain needs to have activity in order to improve memory and intelligence. Besides that, learning new areas of different things gives the opportunity to aquire and then share the knowledge with others who do not know. Another important point is learning languages can decrease levels of violence significantly.  El Salvador has a very  high levels of violence and delincuence. The economy is decreasing, the levels of good education are becoming serious but the main core of those issues is violence. The goverment should create programs with good plans and schemes to solve the situation as soon as posible. If people study languages, the violence would improve the range of violence that the country is having daily. There is a strong connection between violence and education, in this case is learning foreign laguages. The more education people get, the less rates of violence a country has. All of those points would be a long-term consequences for the future if people take action now. The potential of the land is strong and enormuos;however, what the country needs is an extensive and powerful improvement to have positive benefits in order to become a better nation.",5.82W17 LATs,12702,"My roommates are loving and eoncouraga.

Also, they know that I am not familiar with this city, they always give me something famous in this city, such as popular bread, soda, and even tickets to concerts. Secondly, they give me hope and encouragement. To illustrate, there is an  exmple of my Engilsh test.  When I took TOEFL for the first time here in this city, I could not get high enough scores, and I was very disappointed. However, they came up to me and encouraged me.

As they have a new university, youjng people in my city can be motivated to study hard to get into the new university. If the new university has great facilities, young people may want to study there because of the beauty. Nobody wants to syudy in a bad environment. According to the one study, students studying in a tidy and beautiful environment tend to get higher scores on the intelligent test than students who study in an old and dirty places. Therefore, by studing in a beautiful places, their learning abilities may be increased eventually. Secondly, the social abilities of young people in my city may be increased because many young people from other cities may come to the new university and syudy there. Even though my city is located in the country-side, young people in my city may be able to learn more about other cities as they communicate with students from other cities. Also, as they gather together in one place, they may be able to acquire the communication skill, thus it may be able to lead them to have good relationships with others as they start working in the future.In addition, young people can contribute themselves to my city in the future. As they get high education from great faculties, they can increase their knowledge and skills. Also, they may be able to invent new medical technologies, find new methods to teach children, or make the economy of my city better in the future. Since receiving high edications has significant effects on students, they may be able to reduce poverty in my city, the death rate of my city may decrease, and my city may be prospered.In conclusion, young people can be affected positively by establishing new univerities with great faculties and facilities in my city, because their learning and social abilities can be increased, and their cities may be able to prosper in the future.",5.86F15 LATs,22783,"Every one in my family have different interests and hobbys.

Among the different problem faced to the government, education is the big challenge that need to be solve in order to provide the people better opportunities in the future. Education is essential to support people building a carreer and preparing them to live in society.          First, education is the most important part in the process to build your carreer. Carreer is consequence of the decisions and opportunities that you have along of your life.  Preparation involves formal education and experiences that we acquire interacting with people. Mixing formal education and opportunities is the best way to achieve success in your profissional life. For example, those who can have access to better schoos in their childhood will be more prepared to achieve success. They can attend the best universities and apply for high position in companies which only the best have opportunities to work. For sure, education is a vital part of everyone's recipe for a successful carreer.          In addition to prepare you for a successful carreer, education helps you to be a better citizen and one that can make difference in society. Living in society is more than just be part of a group of people living close one another. Respecting and helping others are important lessons we learn at school that make our society enjoyable and delightful. For instance, some countries where the governments have invested in education and their children grow with principles such as mutual respect have showed better life quality and low criminality. Education is as important as the basic needs such as water and food because it can guide the future generations and the way that people treat one another.          In conclusion, helping to improve society and giving you better opportunites in your carreer are some of the benefits of education. Fortaleza has grown in an extraordinary rate, but unfortunately education is a problem to be solved. If the Brazilian government doesn't pay attention to this problem and put all efforts to solve it, we will see our nation decae and become a worse place to live where people don't respect one another and unprepared profissional. It is recommended that everyone has in mind that this problem can affect everyone even those who have access to good education. Helping others to have the same oportunities you have is essential.",5.88W17 LATs,37333,"Some people like to live alone. Others like to live with their families or roommates.

They mostly represent a part of culture and beauty of it, but sometimes cities need improvement. For example, La Paz City is a beautiful city located in Bolivia, South America; but it needs some improvements. One that stands out is more street safety. First, most people are afraid to walk on the streets at night because of the situations that can occur. The news mostly show that people who walk at night by themselves are more likely to suffer a robbery or rape. For example, one can get robbed, or kidnapped. In other words, with the improvement of street safety, these problems can decrease and the citizens can feel safe.Second, with the increase of street safety, parents won't be worrying too much when their kids go outside to play. Street safety is very important and necessary for kids as well, especailly when they are playing because there is always the possibility that some kids may get hurt while playing or even fight. Street safety will help decrease these kind of problems. Third, street safety is also important for schools.  Bullies are everywhere and the kids that are victims often stay quiet. With the help of street safety, these kids who bully innocent kids can be stopped before it is too late. Bullying is a seious matter and it should not be seen as something that will just go away with time.In conclusion, improvement is always important. Some cities need it more than other cities. The point is that improving our city can make it a better place to live, work and have fun. Being able to call a city home is very important and thinking how one can help it become better can even make it a better city.",6.06W17 LATs,06588,"I believe all the people that I have lived with are my friends except for my real family.

This was because I'd never lived in a distant countries and I thought I would live in my country for my whole life. As life cannot be imagined and decided in one way, I was able to stay and start to study here. So, my very first roommate was the most impressive friend that I made here. She was from China and the same age as me. She was a student studying Buisness Administration at UVU, and she had been living in USA since 20 years old. As soon as I arrived at our shared house, she welcomed me very gladly and introduced our house and other roommates. She was trying to be closed to me because she found we are Asians and the same age. As I became closed with her, I realized that she was very kind, amazing, and wonderful because whenever I asked her for anything that I didn't know including cleaning the house, studying English and so on, she was always polite and nice to me with patience. I believed that I would not forget her kindness forever. Even though we are living in other states nowadays because of studying, we are still friends and trying to help each other. This makes me feel happy always.","My city, Incheon, is the second biggest city in South Korea, which has been famous because of the worldwide international airport and very beautiful landscapes with lots of small islands and sea. So, whenever I remind my city, I've been always proud of the amazing and convenient benefits of my city. However, there have been several bad things in my city including environmental problems, transportaion troubles, and supports for college students. Specially, our city has been the top of the cities in Korea about poor supports for college students so that many college students in Incheon have to loan money or stop school to earn tuitions for a long time as tuitions have been increasing every year. This causes them to face big debts even after graduating, and it has been a serious problem to students, parents, and even government. So, as I studied in college in Korea and know that this problem should be solved and dealt with very carefully and effectively with a governmental policy.  First, the policy should have the exact and meaurable data about students who are struggling with big tuitions so that the city council should be able to figure out how many students need supports and why students have problems for college tuitions. This must be the first step for enought supports to college students because usually, government just fulfilled some policies to help them for a long time, but those were just temporary to loan money because of approximate research about students. It does not need anymore for better supports to students.   Second, the policy should be able to be more flexible and open to public, especially to students, parents, and educators so that they know what is going on, what they can do to get supports, and even what they have to improve the policy. Almost always, many administrators have been doing some short-sighted solutions for this problem with an excuse that they don't have enough money for them, which does not make sense to people anymore. This kind of awful situation should be removed by opening the process, consequence, and everything about the policy because the correlated ministers should be awere of what they need to do. It is the most democratically necessary steps.  Last, the policy must have reliable and proper solutions in reality to apply to the problem. Although Incheon is the second biggest city in Korea and held an Asian Games 3 years ago successfully so that Incheon has been greater, some of the educational policies and educators are not progressed. One of the reasons is that almost all the policies are not appropriate to solve problems in reality, especially for tuition supports. I will not know why exactly, but it is true that they are reluctant to focus on and handle the problem properly. So, there have been other troubles of it, which are that students who need support do not get it or do not have enough money for tuitions because of some of the rules of the policy. It cannot make sense to anyone who hears it. This problem should be awaken now for the future of students.  With all these steps, college students may be able to immediate supports for loan and debts, so they would not be stressed anymore. Also, in the long-term perspective, the improved and realistic policy will make Incheon citizens feel proud of Incheon more and more. It should take a lot of time to be fixed and solved well, but as this problem has been the most serious ones for a long time, it should be promptly dealt with right now.",6.12W17 LATs,13194,"I live with my parents and my youngest sister for my whole life, till I moved to the United States.

People between the age of 18 to 30 or teenagers do not have much to do in it. First of all, Ajloun's government should focus on the activities that can make teenagers love it more, because many teenagers are thrilling to move from it, so that if the government focus on the things that can attract teenagers, they will love it more, and they will stay in it. Eventually, when teenagers earn their bachelor's degree, if they do not like their hometown, they won't work in it, and that will make the government lose many benefits from them. Second, there is no good schools in Ajloun - Jordan because it is a small village. Government shouls focus on the education field more in it, so that they will attract more teenagers to it, and that will improve the education level for the next generation. Also, that will decrease poverty and rascism because education is the most powerful method to defeat poverty and rascism. Third, Ajloun - Jordan despite it is a village, and it is a small one, but it has many historical places such as, Mar Al Yas and Ajloun castle. Government should focus on these places to attract tourists to it, and then they will attract many investors to it, and that will open big opportunities for students and teenagers to work and study at the same time. Fourth, churches in Ajloun should focus more on these ages because the only focus on adults and it is a negative thing, because people personalities are shaped since they are children, so that they should start shaping it from a young age. Also, they should give these people enough time to earn the good manners and prinicples from their churches. Eventually, this will lead them to be better people with better and improved personalities, so that they will make Ajloun better place. In conclusion, Ajloun - Jordan has many good historical places which can improve the economic level if the government focus on them, government should focus more on schools so they can improve generations, and churches should focus on all of the ages, so that they can improve people's personalities and make them better and spiritual.",6.12F15 LATs,23423,"I live with three roommates that come from different parts of the world.

It is a beautiful place that is sorrounded by lakes and rivers. In addition, it has different colleges and universities that are mostly free for everyone, even for foreign people. Nevertheless, people my age are afraid to move to my city because crime has increased dramatically in the last years. For that reason, I highly recommend that a few changes be made in order to attract more youth.First, the City Council should increase the security and send more patrols and cops to the streets. University classes usually end late at night and young people, especially young women, are reluctant to walk the dark streets alone for fear of being attacked by strangers. For example, there have been cases where men have raped students because they were alone in the dark. Consequently, women do not feel safe anymore. Having more cops and security would give them a feel of protection.Second, more lights should be added to the dark parts of the city because criminal acts usually happen where there are no lights on. To illustrate, hundreds of students have reported to be robbed when they left classes. They were unable to recognize or see the thief due to the lack of lightening in the area. Furthermore, many of them were aggressively attacked by the criminal, which left them with injuries. Others have had a different luck and were killed because the agressor used a gun or a knife. For all these reasons, I suggest that lights be placed in strategical areas of the city to ensure the safety of students and neighbors.Finally, an accessible insurance coverage should be made available to students to ensure the value of their belongins. This way, people would feel safe in case their computers, cell phones, and other valuable items are stolen. For example, if students lose their essential tools to learn, they would not be able to continue studying because they cannot afford buying them again. As a result, I recommend that this type of insurance be given to all students. To conclude, having more cops, lights in the city, and insurance for all the students would attract more students from different areas. Besides, students already enrolled in classes would feel secure in the city and would be able to enjoy their time there. Although it might take a few years until these changes are noticed by people, eventually more students would hear and learn about these improvements and would feel the desire to move to the city longing for a better future full of opportunities.",6.12S17 Placement,42058,"My name is Paulo.

In our family we love being together in social activities in public parks, especially in the spring and summer season.In my hometown Sao Paulo (Brazil), we do not have many public areas where you can go with your family and stay the day. The public parks are rare and always crowded in the weekends.  Therefore, the local authorities and our mayor should invest our money (taxes) and their time to get some solutions that would improve our quality of life. For example, there are sites all over the city that could be transformed into public parks with little or no public investment. This initiative would be a short-term solution to provide older and younger people with places of leisure and fun.  In the long-run, the government should promote initiatives and even issue a policy to bring cultural events to the city at a lower price. This would contribute to the improvement of our cultural level as well as it would increase the level of satisfaction of the population with lower income. Any investment in culture and education increases the overall quality of life and satisfaction, in my opinion.

Living in another country is not easy because trials and obstacles are always happen, it is part of the life, so encounter them are going to be challenged. However, it is the only way to learn and develop more skills in a future. For example, living with parents were really different because people have more facilities, but living alone or roommates is more challenging. People will learn patience and have to adapt some activities that were not used to do it. Some roommates were  enjoying activities when I had to work during nights and study during the day. My life was just studying and working, I could not enjoy Provo like them, but I was learning something else like responsibility.

At the end, I discovered myself and my self steem was healed. I am a better person because this expericence and every trial just taugth me eternal lessons.","Values are important in people's life and for country's development. In Colombia's case,  especifically, people in Bucaramanga should learn more responsability and honesty, those skills are really important for the human development. Responsabilty and hosnesty are values that have been forgetting and are really important to develop a better country, and there are 2 main reasons which explain why a country is better when it is a culture of responability and honesty. First, comparing to the United States of America , people from Colombia are less responsibles and unfortunately less honest. It is really sad and make the country lazy because are not get used to be on time and  people are  not  going to be serious. When a negative habit is learned is really hard to change it and work on it. For this reason, people should learn not just in 20's aged, it should be learned since child. Children are little sponges learning new skills and habits. When they are learning, they do the same  actions as older people actions. If people example is not good, the culture that children  will be taugth are  going  to be in that maner.  As a consequence, puntuality is affected and  when people arrive late at work can make a difference. For example, if a doctor arrives late and a patient really needs him, this person could die . Now people can see  why it is really needed.  Also, It is really interesting when children are taugth to be responsible since a shorted aged like in America. The culture changed a lot and they will be always on time and their activities in a future are not going to affect other people.Second, honesty is really important too.  At the same as being responsible, being honest is other value that has to be high-lighted. Other people can trust in an honest person , but the population are not going to trust if it is not the case. For example a honest president, people can trust him if that person was honest since childhood and was showing it whith actions, but are not going to  trust in his acts if he showed the oppposite face. In this manner, it is really important to have this culture too. In a future, people can trust that person and can trust not just in his words, but in his actions too because they know that person will care about honesty and how to manage big situations like presidents, more if there is money in the middle. In conclusion Colombia is an amazing country, but unfortunately not all the people are honest and responsible, and on of the major problems is corruption and it starts because a lack of responsible and honest culture. It is really sad to accept it , but changing those inconvenents Colombia will be a better country and fair.

What i like from living with them is that I feel at home, they make me feel part of their family and we have develop such a trust that when we are struggling with whatever we feel comfortable taking about our experiences and emotions with each other. 2 of them are half mexican and half american but we always speak english in the apartment. Speaking english is the rule since only 3 of us speak spanish, one speaks japanese and the other 2 speak only english. One more thing i like from living with them is that we cook together in whe weekends and i think that is something that helped our friendship grow strong.","One improvement that would make the city I live in a better place would be the increasing of job opportunities for young people. In a world that is ever more competitive, having a laboral experience since youth might qualify someone to acquire a future job, it would help youth be more accountable about their actions and feel more independent. Moreover, having more job opportunities for young people would increase the economy as a long-term consequence and would reduce violence and delinquency as a long-term consequence.When a young person finds the opportunity to work, either full-time or have-time, he will start gaining experience that may be necessary in the future. A person who works since he is young will start seeing life from a different perspective. In fact, this person will start to have more realistic thoughts because he will start ti feel what life is all about and awaits him in the future. For example, if a 19 year-old person who studies to become a dentist finds a job that involves being among dentists, either a hospital or a private clinic, this person will have the opportunity to learn from them and apply that learning into their classes and future career. On the other hand, a person who works in a job which might not be related to what he is studying at all may also obtain a benefit from it. This person will start looking at his own life from a different perspective. That person will realize how hard life may get if he does not prepare enough. Therefore, giving young people the opportunity to work in a full-time or a half-time job may help them acquire more experience for their future careers and to obtain another perspective of what life is .When young people start working, they become productive and start following a established schedule that brings balance into their lives. On the other hand. when young people do not work they stop being productive and that is when they start making wrong decisions. It is when someone has too much free time when someone decides to drink alcohol or look after things that are not appropiate. However, giving youth the opportunity to work may help them have a balance in their lives as they become ever more independent and accountable for their actions. For example, when a person starts working since he is young, this person will learn about and value more the sacrifice made by his parents to give them a good education. Moreover, obtaining a job would help him to be more independent and realize that every action he makes in the present may have an impact on who he will become in the future. Thus, obtaining a full-time or part-time job do not only provide an economic benefit to the youth but also principles that will accompany them throughout the rest of their lives.As a matter of fact, Giving young people the opportunity to work may also have short-term and long-term consequences in a society.  GIving the youth the opportunity to work would increase the economy as more people would be willing to invest on it. Furthermore, many people who fell into delinquency due to the lack of employment in a city would start working to obtain a righteous life and provide their family with what they need. Thus, violence and delinquency would be reduce if young people have the opporunity to sustain themselves because they would no longer see delinquency as the only source of money if they can't afford a good education at the moment.In conclusion, providing job opportunities to young people in my city would solve many of the problems that it is facing right now. Helping young people obtain jobs would not only the economy grow but also people.  As people start progressing since they are young they will become more accountable and they will be ready to take the responsabilies that having a family and the society brings.",6.67
